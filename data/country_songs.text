[Verse 1]
A dirt road, a cold beer
A blue jeans, a red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective
No shoes, no shirt
No Jews, you didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I could sing in Mandarin
You'd still know I'm pandering
Huntin' deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out
Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl in a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry
A cold night, a cold beer
A cold jeans, strike that last one
I'm wanting you, I hope you're feeling me
Sub-textually

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to
Legalize gerry-mandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)

Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

[Bridge]
Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word "truck," they jizz in their overalls
You don't know what land you're in
I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront
I do what I do 'cause I'm a total fuckin' country boy

[Intro]
It's RickyRick on the beat
Not fucking playin' around, Jenny, get in the fuckin' house now, bitch
Better count your fucking days, mom, fuck you all, bitch
Hey
Major Grammar

[Chorus]
I just got some new boots, and a new tractor
Get on my tractor, ran right past her
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor
Finna marry my sister, 'cause she's fuckin' hot bro
I just got some new boots, finna hop on my tractor (Yee-haw)
I hopped on my tractor, I rode straight past her (Yee-haw)
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor (Yee-haw)
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor (Yee-haw)

[Verse]
Take a look at my boots, diamondback snake skin
Man, I love tobacco dip, that shit makes my head spin
My wife has a flat ass, but she has some big tits
Try to fuck my wife, don't you fuckin risk it
12 Gauge buckshot, aim it at your dreadlocks
My wife wants to fuck me 'cause I have a fat cock
And I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four wheel drive
I'm eating some deer meat, country boys can survive

[Chorus]
I just got some new boots and a new tractor
Get on my tractor, ran right past her
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor
Finna marry my sister, 'cause she's fucking hot bro
I just got some new boots, finna hop on my tractor (Yee-haw)
I hopped on my tractor, I rode straight past her (Yee-haw)
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor (Yee-haw)
Fucked her in the pasture, yup, on my tractor (Yee-haw)

[Verse 1]
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
Hell, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

[Chorus: Garth Brooks & Crowd]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
Hell, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
Hell, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places
'Cause I've got friends in low places

My blues away, and I'll be okay
Hell, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

[Verse 3]
I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran + Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

I just wanna know you, know you, know you

You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name

You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Heaven's not
Ready for you

Needs you more

Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'

We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

Can't wait to see you soar

[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

[Verse 1]
Tumble outta bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

[Verse 2]
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"

Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone

Oh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out [shot, shot, shot]
What a mess now (c'mon)

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can

You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own

Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger

Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

[Verse 3]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

[Chorus]
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get stoned in my backyard
Lay off in the tall grass, so my view is of stars
I think about nothin', get to clear my thoughts
From all the thunder and lightnin' so I feel a spark
Sometimes I get higher than the Colorado Rockies
Hopin' that the county sheriff don't stop me
Like Charlie Daniels said, you shouldn't smoke that dope
But damn it I can't help, I love rollin' stoned

[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up door
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But, hell, I can't help I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

[Verse 2]
Smoke rollin' 'round the cab with the dome light on
Lookin' like a stage for a Lynyrd Skynyrd song
Hangin' out with Mary Jane but she's makin' the time go slow
Makin' memories with my buddies through the thick green smoke
Puff passin' out the windows of my old Tahoe
Lifted so damn high I can't come down
Drivin' under the speed limit in my town

[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up door
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But hell, I can't help, I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

[Bridge]
There ain't nothin' like the swayin' of a windy back road
Baked out like a barn full of tobacco
I know Jesus drank wine but I bet he wouldn't mind
Sittin' with me in my Chevy, passin' 'round a few times

[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down, the radio up
Sweet tea full in our Solo cups
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Like a concert out my beat up door
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Ol' Willie said there's not nothin' wrong with smokin' dope
So light one up, and lets go rollin' stoned
So pass me that, and lets start rollin' stoned

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb thumpin' on the wheel right
The mix in our drinks, a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
Trucks jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio

This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town with nothin' else to do
We take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though
(Let's roll!)

This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

Pass it around and we dream about one day

Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright

Coming home, home, home, mmm

I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 2:]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But it's worth making

Don't let some Hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone)

He says I'm, just a featherweight

And I can win with no one in my corner
So don't you even try to hold me back

You say I can't - well, darling, watch me
You can't stop me 'cause I fight like a girl

Hell, that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Bridge]
Just let me dust off the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather

Oh, yeah
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor

[Verse 1]
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

[Verse 2]
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone

I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

[Chorus]
I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong

Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Can't go back, I'm haunted

Drinkin' at the Legion

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

[Chorus: Faith Hill]
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying

To say I have been missing you
Is the worst thing possible I could ever do
And to sleep one more night next to you
Should be out of the question
Don't ask me no question like
If I love you because I don't
I don't love you, selfish don't love nobody
I can't love you like you should be loved

(Koe Wetzel)
Don't talk crazy and killing your self won't change a god damn thing If it's help that you need, I know a place down the street
And the storm is moving in, it's been raining for five full days
And I know now is not the best time but I just got to say, I don't I don't I don't love you
Selfish don't love nobody
I can't love you, like you should be loved

(Parker McCollum)
Was it an accident?
When a broken heart and a bullet mark is all that she left
To ask if I give a damn, should be out of the question
Don't ask me no question 'cause

[Verse 1]
I woke up in Nashville
But it still felt like a dream
Like the one I've been chasing
Since the day I first played my dad's six string

[Pre-Chorus]
I loaded up the hand-me-down car
Went for broke, broke your heart
Didn't wanna but, girl, I thought I had to
But dreaming's just sleeping here without you

[Chorus]
So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

[Verse 2]
I woke up in Nashville
'Cause those Broadway lights don't shine
The way that your eyes did
When they were staring back, right back in mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Been trying to live with only half of my heart
Just sleepwalking in the Tennessee dark
If I can't make every memory with you
Then dreaming's just sleeping here without you

[Chorus]
So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

[Bridge]
In a cold sweat
And catching my breath
Dropping my pride
And dropping you a line
I don't know where you are
I don't know who you're with
I don't know what to say
But I'm saying it

[Chorus]
Hello
I'm glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without

Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before, we, said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again
Ho, but I think, she's leavin'

I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
Ho, I think, she's leavin'

All those LA west coast silicone women
Really think they're hot
But it's no fun titty fuckin' titties when the titties are hard as rocks
And up in New York City all them uptight bitties
Like to shave their cooch
But I prefer a little fur on my burger
If you're wantin' me to tell the truth

[Chorus]
I like my puss in boots
A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Waylon tune
While she's hummin' on my cock and balls
I want a girl in a cowboy hat
Her tongue knows where my butthole's at
Bush pokin' out her Daisy Dukes
I like my puss in boots
Boots

[Verse 2]
Well the girls in Chicago, they can spit, they can swallow
When they're on their knees
But it's hard to stay hard when you're fuckin' in a car it's four degrees
All the girls in Milwaukee wanna slob on my cocky
But I have to pass
Cause I only get wood when my dick is up a good ol' Southern ass

I like my puss in boots
A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Willie tune

A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Wheeler tune

[Verse 1]
I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

[Verse 2]
'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

[Chorus]
We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 3]
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

[Chorus]
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Burnin' both ends of the night

[Verse 1]
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms

[Verse 1]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

[Verse 2]
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever

Yeah, breaker Pig Pen this here's the Duck
And uh, you wanna back off them hogs
Uh, ten-four 'bout five mile or so
Ten-Roger them hogs is gettin' intense up here

[Verse 2]
By the time we got into Tulsa Town
We had eighty-five trucks in all
But they's a road block up on the clover leaf
And them bears was wall to wall
Yeah, them smokies was thick as bugs on a bumper
They even had a bear in the air
I says, callin' all trucks
This here's the Duck
We about to go a huntin' bear

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a great big convoy
Rockin' through the night

Uh, negatory Pig Pen you're still too close
Yeah, them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses
Mercy sakes, you'd better back off another ten

[Verse 3]
Well, we rolled up Innerstate fourty-four
Like a rocket sled on rails
We tore up all of our swindle sheets
And left 'em settin' on the scales
By the time we hit that Chi-Town
Them bears was a gettin' smart
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard
There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of every size
Yeah, them chicken coops was full of bears
And choppers filled the skies
Well, we shot the line
We went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
And eleven long haired Friends of Jesus
In a Chartreuse microbus

[CB Radio Chatter]
Yeah, Rubber Duck to Sod Buster
C'mon there
Yeah, Ten-Four Sod Buster
Listen, you wanna put that microbus
In behind that suicide jockey?
Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite
And he needs all the help he can get

[Verse 4]
Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey Shore
Prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a doggone dime
I says, Pig Pen this here's the Rubber Duck
We just ain't a gonna pay no toll
So we crashed the gate doin' 98
I says let them truckers roll
Ten-Four

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a mighty convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a mighty convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight
C'mon and join our Convoy

Bye, bye


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year

[Chorus]
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

[Verse 2]
I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”

[Chorus]
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

[Verse 3]
Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other

[Outro]
So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning

[Intro]
No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

[Verse 2]
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' [whistle]
Sayin', "Hey, girl" (Hey, girl)
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't "Pretty little thing"
"Hottie" or "Baby"
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy

[Chorus]
Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Verse 2]
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time "You gotta get you some of that"
Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that

[Chorus]
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Bridge]
(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady

[Chorus]
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)

[Outro]
I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw (Haha)


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

[Outro]
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'

Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 3]
Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?"
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Verse 1]
Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Verse 2]
Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar

If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[Verse 2]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want

So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't

If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em

Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun

Only live once

I only had a couple drinks last night
And few good hits from an end of a pipe
And I must admit, I had a few white lines
And I don't know what all happened
I woke up in the noon time light
With a poundin' head, shiner on my eye
And I don't know how and I don't why
But it feels like fierce abandon

[Chorus]
Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God

[Verse 2]
Pay no mind to the words I say
Cause they ain't no count anyway
I been ramblin' around and led astray
By the paths that I been choosin'
Cuttin' paths like a forest fire
Pupils wider than backhoe tires
Throwin' my money on a funeral pyre
But it sure feels good abusin'

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight

But when the evenin' comes around

Bands too loud for their bible thumpin'
Feels too good to not count for somethin'
Big Sandy rock, Sludge River roll
Goddamn, fire in the hole
Look out baby, I'm bound to blow
I'm bound to blow a gasket
Damn good gig, good damn crowd
Good God, for cryin' out loud
Coming off stage I was mighty proud
Then I don't know what all happened

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone

My friend David was a good kid
He had my back, always knew he did
He was different than most
And maybe I was too
Hanging out with the in-crowd just wasn't our thing
There was a whole lot more
Than we could see on these plains
Well, some people just seem to get stuck, and hang around
It's college or trade school for those with the means
There's never been any small town dreams
For those in between
Yeah the poor folks they go to work, or they go to war
I did fifteen hundred days in the Corps
And I got back, nothing looked the same anymore
I got on with the local police, it just seemed to fit
Things have changed

By then David had a daughter and a son
And a rap sheet to prove all the time that he'd done
He was just a burned out, beat down shell of my old friend
And on a three-day binge he was speeding through town
And I bumped the wailers just to try to slow him down
He didn't know it was me, and he took off
Oh how things change

And I found his truck in the floodplain upside down
It was a hell of a rain I don't know if he drowned
Or if he died on impact, must have rolled three times
Yeah, the only thing to make matters worse
Is that his mama's a late night ER nurse
And he was DOA, she just about lost her mind

David's wife drops by every once in a while
And childhood stories always make her smile
But somehow we always go back to that day

When I found his truck in the floodplain upside down
It was a hell of a rain, I don't know if he drowned
Or if he died on impact, it must have rolled three times
Yeah, the only thing to make matters worse
Is that his mama's a late night ER nurse
And he was DOA, she just about lost her mind

And ain't it the times?

I've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
To the open arms, wait for me

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom

Good night Irene, good night Irene

Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I haves a great notion
Jumping in, into the river and drown

Stay there by the fireside bright

I'm gonna take morphine and die

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right

[Verse 1]
She came from Providence
The one in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came across the sea

[Verse 2]
She heard about a place people were smiling
They spoke about the red man's way
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

[Verse 3]
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

[Verse 4]
Then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

[Verse 5]
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught them
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And Jesus people bought them
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea

[Verse 6]
You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign: "Jesus is coming"
Brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

[Verse 7]
Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
Because there is no more new frontier
We have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs and
Justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

[Verse 8]
And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye

There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down

[Verse 2]
You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you
When you're not around?

[Bridge]
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder

[Verse 3]
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

[Chorus]
Where you've been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
He's holding her, and you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's talking 'bout the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's walking like the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it, ah ooh
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town

Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you

[Verse 2]
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"

I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side

Still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"

She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me

She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me

Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun
And the days blur into one
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done
Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Was never much but we made the most

[Chorus]
Welcome home

[Verse 2]
Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost
Peel the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars

[Chorus]
I've come home

All my nightmares escaped my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs, I feel your thumbs press into my skin again

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

[Chorus: Keith Urban & Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side

And you can't see me in the middle of the night

There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life

Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sat down and cried today

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

Telling me that we're no good

Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no

Tomorrow I'll be stronger

When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop
No matter how bad I want to

Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow

Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail

Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

[Verse 4]
Up jumps the whale, the largest of all
"If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!"

[Chorus]
And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys;
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

Not seeing that love in you
That’s what I was trying to do

[Verse 1]
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places

'Cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away

Oh, I got friends in low places

[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

[Verse]
Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again

(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

[Verse 2]
I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time little darling
I'm coming home to stay

[Verse 3]
I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose

"Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-"

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody see?

Watching the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strumming my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they're beginning to boil

Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

[Verse 2]
Don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

[Chorus]
Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

[Verse 3]
I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there’s booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

[Chorus]
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
But I know it’s my own damn fault

Yes, and some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
And I know it’s my own damn fault

Tried to amend my carnivorous habits
Made it nearly seventy days
Losin' weight without speed, eatin' sunflower seeds
Drinkin' lots of carrot juice and soakin' up rays
But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams
Some kind of sensuous treat
Not zucchini, fettuccini, or bulgur wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat

Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular, not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

Heard about the old time sailor men
They eat the same thing again and again
Warm beer and bread they say could raise the dead
Well, it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn
But times have changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just Havanas or bananas or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed

[Chorus 2]
Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium rare with Muenster'd be nice
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

[Bridge]
I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god Almighty which way do I steer?

[Chorus 3]
For my cheeseburger in paradise
Makin' the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise;
To be a cheeseburger in paradise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Verse 2]
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that

Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room

It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, "I love you, too" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will

In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

It's fearless

From the dusty mesa
Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
Of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood

[Verse 2: Rennie Sparks]
In the hushing dusk, under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
A strange hunger haunted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt a trembling hand

[Bridge: Brett Sparks and Rennie Sparks]
When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones

Across the silent sands
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my hands

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Outro: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)

[Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

[Verse 1]
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

[Chorus]
She said, "Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"

[Verse 2]
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, "Your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death"
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl
Across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking mama, "What do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"

[Chorus]
She said, "Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
"Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your mama's gonna move you uptown

[Verse 3]
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama had been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was going to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

[Chorus]
She said, "Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"

[Verse 4]
It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea in a five room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

[Verse 5]
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
"Here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
"Oh, here's your one chance Fancy, don't let me down"
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out
Well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, honey
Mama's gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did

"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen

[Verse 2]
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

[Outro]
Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen

Hey, hey
Keep your chin up
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

[Chorus]
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Verse 2]
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

You gotta love, love, love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush, you're the rush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of

[Chorus]
Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

[Verse 2]
I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

Oh, don't try to save me
Oh, you never gonna save me

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose

Take me to the edge and one step past it

For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two

So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you

One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying

I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

Take a look all around, and I'll be there

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no gripe to bear

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be

Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 2]
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance

First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 4]
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)

Bet you'd wonder what I’d do
I think that I'd start goin' out
Get caught kissin’ other dudes

With your bad attitude (bad attitude)
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through

I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

[Verse 2]
If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun (have so much fun)
First things first I'd gather up all my girls, yeah
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, it’d be so nice not to worry, yeah
How I’d love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
I’m sick of wearing this silly dress

Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone
I know

I know that I gave you my heart

And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

[Verse 2]
You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave

And I wanna show you what I see tonight

[Chorus]
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted

[Bridge]
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

[Chorus/Outro]
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted

Cause you'll always be wanted

[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, "Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it

[Verse 1: Dan & Shay]
Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you

[Chorus 1: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

[Verse 2: Dan & Shay]
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain

[Chorus 2: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

[Verse 3: Dan & Shay]
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still

[Chorus 3: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

[Verse 1]
Little Jackie Paper
Loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax
And other fancy stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

[Verse 2]
Together they would travel
On a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a look-out
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail

[Verse 3]
Noble kings and princes
Would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags
When Puff roared out his name

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea

A dragon lives forever
But not so, little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings
Make way for other toys

[Verse 5]
One grey night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar

[Verse 6]
His head was bent in sorrow
Green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
Along the cherry lane

[Verse 7]
Without his lifelong friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon
Sadly slipped into his cave

[Chorus]
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the Autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Verse 2]
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

That's right, you got me shakin'

When you take me in your arms and talk romance
My heart starts doin' that Saint Rita dance
And I'm pantin'
Oh and I'm shakin'

Early in the mornin' time
Late in the middle of the night
Whenever this chill comes over me
I wanna hug ya' with all of my might
That's right and I'm sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin'
Mmm, ya' got me sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin' girl

A chill and a fever, so I've been told
Makes your head spin around and your feet run cold
I got fever, yeah
Fever yeah I burn forsooth

I feel like I been run right through the mill
And I can't move around and I can't stand still
I'm Bo Diddley
Oh, you got me shakin'
I'm so jittery
That's right, you got me shakin'

Well Samson was a mighty good man
Strongest in his day
(Then along came Delilah and clipped his wig)
And it looks like you took me the same old way
So I'm nervous
Oh and I'm shakin'
Alright, you got me nervous
Yeah, I'm shakin' and jumpin'

A storm rocks a ship on a sea (A storm rocks a ship on a sea)
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree (The wind shakes the leaves on a tree)

And that's what you're doin' to me right now

[Verse 1: Jesse Stewart]
I kinda get broken when it comes to emotion
Makes me start choking, so I sit by the ocean
I spent my last buck on a bottle of whiskey
Drunk and broke, sittin' here in history
I made my mind up, how I'm going
Got nowhere to go
Don't know where I'm going
I do know one thing, one thing that is true
Wherever I go, I'm gonna need you
We just can't let each other go now
We're too close, to ever slow down
The only one who keeps my chin up
When you touch my lips, we're like two dogs stuck

[Chorus]
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
Never live without you
Don't care what I amount to no
Talkin' bout cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry I'm right here
I could never live without you

[Verse 2]
I pick you up, I take you home
Sit on my couch, turn off my phone
'Cause I love your taste, love your smell
Who'd have ever thought that we could do so well?
Hell, I guess we're meant for each other
Sort'a like the microphone and my buddy Bruce Buffer
I can't really express my joy
Sorta like a scrap between Osgood and Patty Roy
I can't take my eyes off you
Went to rehab, thought that I lost you
But now we're back together, with a vengeance
Must be my little Irish descendance
It feels pretty good to get this off my chest
Even though people sayin' Jesse's obsessed
Well maybe I am, maybe they're right
One thing that I know, it was love at first sight

[Chorus]
Yeah cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I could never live without you
I wouldn't even want to
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry I am right here
Never live without you
You care what I amount to

[Verse 3]
Well I'm sittin' on my stoop feeling kinda lonely
Me and Brenda fightin' so I called up the homies
But the b'ys are busy hangin' out, in front of Sobeys
There's only one little feller, who really knows me
He comes in a little brown bottle or can
Sits in my hand 'til I can barely stand
He's part of the fam, he's part of the team
Took me under his wing when I was just a teen
Every time he comes around it always
Takes me back to when I had a fake ID, and a little dirt 'stache
Get a road soak, cold pop, two-four, wob pop, pop top, twist top, tall boy, cold shot

[Chorus]
Beer! Cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I could never live without you
You don't care what I amount to
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I couldn't fuckin live without you
I wouldn't even want to

Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, I'll take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 4]
I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

[Verse 5]
Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face—guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you

I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt
I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead"
I was like, "He couldn't had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the chance then I'll head home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend

I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
God chose us, and gave it up
Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us
It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D
I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up

No matter what you might say
No matter what I say

No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo

This land is your land, and this land is my land
From the California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters

To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
All around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters

And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling

From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters

As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there
And that sign said "No trespassin'"
But on the other side .... it didn't say nothin!
Now that side was made for you and me!

This land is your land, and this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'
If this land's still made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living can ever make me turn back

Have you seen the old man
In the closed-down market
Kicking up the paper
With his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
And held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk

We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

I’ll be the last one standing
Two hands in the air, I’m a champion
You’ll be looking up at me when it’s over
I live for the battle, I’m a soldier, yeah

Unstoppable, unshakeable

You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
When they write my story
They're gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don’t think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance, I’m taking
All them old records, I’m breaking
All you people watching on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay

I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion, oh

[Bridge: Ludacris]
Born champion, Luda!
The C is for the courage I possess through the trauma
H is for the hurt, but it’s all for the honor
A is for my attitude, working through the patience
Money comes and goes, so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is to persevere
The I is for integrity, innovative career
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary 'cause I’m never givin’ up
See, they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushin' the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
Carrie!

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name

I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

I’m the champion, yeah, surpassed all rivals

Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall

Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And, and each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna, gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

Well you know you got it, if it makes you feel good

And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

[Verse 1]
You were wearing that black dress, coat, and cowboy boots
He was there, but I didn't care, I was too busy staring at you
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin', in the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared, I asked you what had happened

[Chorus]
But I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You were wearing that red dress, pearls, and those high heels
Liked the way it made you look, you love the way it made you feel
So I said to you, "I'd sure love to do this again"
And you said, "Me too, but I'm just not over him"

[Chorus]
And I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me, yeah

[Bridge]
She started calling me baby, and two years later, I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said, "I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?"

[Chorus 2]
She said, "You know that I'm ready
And I have been for awhile
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready
So that's alright with me
That's alright with me"

A stray bullet and a mama  cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

The band was jumping and the joint began to swing

You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Mama always said you'd be
The Chosen One.

She said: You're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes

You woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your Papa never told you
About right and wrong

But you're looking good, baby
I believe you're feeling fine,(shame about it)
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes

[Chorus]
You woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes

You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same
Since the blues walked into town
But you're one in a million
You've got that shotgun shine (shame about it)
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if
You'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to the others;
Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you
Didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink?
Well you do so make up your mind to go on, 'cause
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You want to be the Chosen One

Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Verse 1]
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand

Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

[Verse 2]
Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay

Going home now to stay

And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay

Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

A little more with every song
So sing along

Burning through my veins

Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

[Verse 2]
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like

Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing

I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3]
Head down, ass up, feelin' like a cockstar
Watch it grow up in my mouth every time it's not hard
Open up the box, then eat it up just like a Pop-Tart
Make the dick harder than back seats in a cop car
Why the fuck do you keep pullin' my tracks?
'Cause if it fall out, bitch, then you gluin' it back
I'm tryna suck your dick 'til my jaws get swole
I'm tryna ride like Rosa Parks on the road

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line (Brian Kelley)]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 1]
I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front porch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with a two stroke
A couple guaranteed-to-make-ya-laugh jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

[Verse 2]
I got a girl named Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
Got a job that gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on a wall, "For a good time, call"
I'm a local legend on a Friday night
Then a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a neon light

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

[Bridge]
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
(Yeah, let's go, come on)

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

[Verse 1]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Verse 2]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Verse 3]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge]
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

[Verse 2]
I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'

Got friends to call who let me talk about

If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float

[Verse 1]
Oh, he treats me with respect
He says he loves me all the time
He calls me fifteen times a day
He likes to make sure that I'm fine
You know I've never met a man
Who's made me feel quite so secure
He's not like all them other boys
They're all so dumb and immature

[Pre-Chorus]
There's just one thing
That's getting in the way
When we go up to bed
You're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes
I want to get to know ya
And then you make this noise
And it's apparent it's all over

It's not fair
And I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean

Yeah, all you do is take

[Verse 2]
Oh, I lie here in the wet patch
In the middle of the bed
I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by
I spent ages giving head
Then I remember all the nice things
That you ever said to me
Maybe I'm just overreacting
Maybe you're the one for me

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive

To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

On my way to you

All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 3]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild

Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

You said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today

Come back, be here, come back, be here

You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on

Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on

She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
She's my baby
I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her go

[Verse 2: Iris Dement]
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby
And I'm his honey
I'm never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes

[Verse 3: John Prine]
She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs
She takes a lickin'
And keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her go

[Verse 4: Iris Dement]
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
He's my baby
I don't mean maybe

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good

Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
Its always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah the dark days find a way

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same

Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

The camera captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane

Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street

Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"

"Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more."

When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack into that district court"

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, in the first degree
I hollered, "Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pin
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whisky, and let that cocaine be

Son más de treinta años que llevamos instalados gobernando y lo debemos al señor que está guardado
No es tan fácil la tarea pero sabemos trabajar ya bastante del negocio y aquí ya no hay vuelta atrás
Estatura bajita, traemos puesta la camisa, ya sabrán de qué bandera pues arriba La Chapiza
No nos quedamos parados, le seguimos atorando, toda la gente del viejo ahorita sigue laborando
Responsabilidad grande, ahora somos la cabeza, la nómina ahorita llega, ya saben que aquí no hay mermas
Medios de alta frecuencia, líder comunicaciones, la línea más veloz, en uno les cae el garrote
Bien firme el 19 pa' cualquier tipo de atraco, en caso de anomalías se acuarea de inmediato
Lanzapapas, lanzallamas, kamikaze, son suicidas, con pistolas en las piernas y en las manos cargan piñas

Tiro arriba por si truena, reglamentaria si hay ofensa, tolerante, no te enredes, si no ya valiste ve-
Somos un chingo de gente involucrada, si se ofrece tengo power junto a toda la manada
Proyectiles, fusiles, una que otra blindada, se miran de nuevo camionetas empotradas
Agarren marinos azules y pintos, de todos colores, todos hemos visto
Bien firme, no cambio bandera, mi amigo, nos vamos de frente con los enemigos
Armas, mujeres, carros deportivos, moviendo trabajo, champaña, efectivo
Relojes muy caros, grupos, es en vivo, disfruto el momento, me gano lo mío
La chamba de nosotros ya se extiende a largo alcance, hasta el viejo continente a güeros surtimos de a madre
Jugando como al Tetris acomodando cuadritos, todo llega a su destino, igual pa' atrás los billetitos
Salud a mis compadres de adentro y de afuera, al de la suerte, ya mero llega
Un abrazo a mi hermano también, mi confidente, siempre estamos unidos y ahorita más que siempre
Es clara nuestra piel, pegue con las damitas, voy conociendo a tres y ahorita me espera otra cita
En un jet disparado salgo rápidamente si la cosa ya de plano se puso muy caliente

I left drinking on the city train
To spend some time on the road
Then one morning I woke up in LA
Caught my breath on the coast
I've been going through a change
I might never be sure
I'm just walking in a haze
I'm not ready to turn

[Chorus]
No woman
No woman

[Verse 2]
Midnight driving through the bay
Going back on the road
Coming up and I wish I could stay
I've been sleeping alone
I've been going through a change
I might never be sure
I'm just walking in a haze
I'm not ready to turn

Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love

While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

At a Siding

While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

I was born under a wandering star
I was born under a wandering star

Wheels are made for rolling, mules are made to pack
I've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back

I was born under a wandering star

Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry
Home is made for coming from, for dreams of going to
Which with any luck will never come true

I was born under a wandering star
I was born under a wandering star

Do I know where hell is? Hell is in "hello"
Heaven is goodbye forever, it's time for me to go

I was born under a wandering star
A wandering, wandering star

(Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry
Home is made for coming from, for dreams of going to
Which with any luck will never come true)

(I was born under a wandering star
I was born under a wandering star)

When I get to heaven tie me to a tree
Or I'll begin to roam, and soon you'll know where I will be

A wandering, wandering star

If I could be stronger
And if you were just older
We might last this out longer
But the task just gets harder
And my face turned to red
From drinking all that dead water
And then again when you said
That I was my mother's daughter

[Chorus]
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I'm on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left, they left me in pieces
Shaky, but I believe
There are better things for me

[Verse 2]
If my legs were longer
They might carry us further
But we waited too long
And so the task just gets harder
And the thoughts that come in
They come on stronger and stronger
And it takes all of me
To just stay out of the water

[Chorus]
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I'm on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left, they left me in pieces
Shaky, but I believe
When you left, you left for a reason

Ohhhh, take me to the things I see I see
My eyes can reach passed all that's been laid out for me

[Verse 1]
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

[Verse 2]
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue."

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue."

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!"

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

I was raised up believing I was somehow unique
Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes
Unique in each way you can see
And now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be
A functioning cog in some great machinery
Serving something beyond me
But I don't, I don't know what that will be
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

[Verse 2]
What's my name, what's my station
Oh, just tell me what I should do
I don't need to be kind to the armies of night
That would do such injustice to you
Or bow down and be grateful and say
"Sure, take all that you see"
To the men who move only in dimly lit halls and determine my future for me
And I don't, I don't know who to believe
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

[Verse 3]
If I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see
Of the world outside is so inconceivable
Often, I barely can speak
Yeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy
And I can't keep it to myself
What good is it to sing helplessness blues?
Why should I wait for anyone else?
And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf
I'll come back to you someday soon myself

[Outro]
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm raw
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
And you would wait tables and soon run the store
Gold hair in the sunlight, my light in the dawn
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
Someday I'll be like the man on the screen

And this is how you make yourself worthy of the love that she

And remember him back when he was small enough to help you sing

You thought God was an architect, now you know
He’s something like a pipe bomb ready to blow

This is how you see yourself floating on the ceiling
And this is how you help her when her heart stops beating
What happened to the part of you that noticed every changing wind

And this is how you talk to her when no one else is listening
And this is how you help her when the muse goes missing
You vanish so she can go drowning in a dream again

Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me

But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

You got wrapped up in other plans

I'm afraid that we just might drown

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Verse 3: Vince Gill]
Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Breakdown: Maren Morris]
Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all

[Chorus]
I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, "Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

[Chorus]
Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Chorus]
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you dream impossible things?

Pretty young thing going dancing in the rain

Business man with a needle and a spoon
Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon

Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey

Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside

When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'

Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."

[Chorus 1]
Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Are you with me so far?

[Verse 2]
Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

[Chorus 2]
Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

[Verse 3]
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring."
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash."
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off

And it was life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Verse 3]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I loved

[Verse 4]
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Verse 5]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Verse 6]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back, and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 7]
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Verse 8]
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 9]
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena I go

[Verse 10]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Verse 11]
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 12]
But my love for Feleena is strong, and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Verse 13]
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye

I done Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran
North Korea tell me where does it end
Well the bodies keep piling up with every day
How many more of em they gonna send

Well they send their sons and daughters off to die for some oil
To control the heroin
Well son I hope you don’t grow up
Believing that you’ve got to be a puppet to be a man

[Verse 2]
Well they cut off your hair and put a badge on your arm
Strip you of your identity
Tell you to keep your mouth shut boy and get in the line
Meet your maker over seas

Wearing that Kim Jong-il hat
Grandma’s selling pills
And meanwhile, I’m wearing my "can’t pay my fucking bills" hat

[Verse 3]
Well nobody’s looking up to care about a drone
All too busy looking down at our phone
Ego’s begging for food like a dog from a feed
Refreshing obsessively until our eyes start to bleed
They serve up distractions and we eat them with fries
Until the bombs fall out of our fucking skies

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair

And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you

'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

They say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I’d pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 2]
They say good things come to those who wait
It’s like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing’s more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you’re right here?

[Verse 3]
And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard, so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you’re my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won’t waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 4]
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones

But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

[Verse 2]
At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better

It wasn't no gun they held to my head
I got caught up believing in lies that were said
And in a moment of weakness
I stumbled and I made my bed

I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man

I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand

To prove I'm not the devil you think that I am

[Verse 1]
Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately, some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition

[Chorus 1]
They get on me and want to know, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over, everybody makes my predictions
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition

[Verse 2]
I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition

[Chorus 2]
So don't ask me, Hank, why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I said leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition

[Verse 3]
Lordy I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, "Son how'd you get in this condition?"
I said, "a-hey sawbones, I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition"

[Chorus 3]
So don't ask me, Hank, why do you drink? Hank, Why do you roll smoke?

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

[Intro]
Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this

[Verse 1]
I’m sorry I named the album ‘Montevallo’
And I’m sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I’m sorry you can’t listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham

I know you want your privacy
And you’ve got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me

'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

[Chorus]
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

[Verse 2]
A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love, it's the kind you can't fall out of

[Chorus]
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much
Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

[Verse 3]
I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

[Outro]
Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gon' say to you
But I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg

Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl

You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side

Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road

You packed up your stuff
It’s really over
Said you’ve had enough
There’s one thing
I’d like to say
‘Fore you leave, baby

Fuck you bitch
You broke my heart
Fuck your friends
For tearing us apart
Fuck your dog
Hope he never comes home
Fuck you bitch
Hope you wind up alone

Now you’re gone
And I’m by myself
Jerkin’ off
To pictures on the cell
But before
I swipe on your face
I just scream

I'd still walk in that bar a little drunk
I'd still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name
I'd still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2am
Even though we break up in the end

[Verse 2]
I'd introduce you to my mom and dad
Say "I think I love her" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in
Even though we break up in the end

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

[Verse 3]
I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it
Even though we break up in the end

[Chorus]
Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Girl, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

You've just had one too many tonight
You're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay
But you know if you come over, I can't not let you in

I'd do it over and over, again and again

The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Verse 2]
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke, too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Chorus]
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn

[Verse 3]
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Verse 4]
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just "hillbilly"
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some Beech-Nut in that dude's eyes
And shoot him with my old .45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We're from north California and south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
"He's an outlaw loose and running"
Came the whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip"
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (she deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)

Let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause

Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything

Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back

Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause

Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge

Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss

[Bridge: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

[Final Chorus: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’

You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

I'm a stone's throw from the mill
And I'm a good walk to the river
When my workin' day is over
We'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water
And a smile across your face
And tell me that you love me
Lovely Lady May

Now I ain't the sharpest chisel
That your hands have ever held
But darlin' I could love you well
Til' the roll is called on high
I've seen my share of trouble
And I've held my weight in shame
But I'm baptized in your name
Lovely Lady May

Lord the wind can leave you shiverin'
As it waltzes o'er the leaves
It's been rushin' through my timber
Til' your love brought on the spring
Now the mountains all are blushin'
And they don't know what to say
'Cept a good long line of praises
For my lovely Lady May

Now I ain't the toughest hickory
That your ax has ever fell
But I'm a hickory just as well
I'm a hickory all the same
I came crashin' through the forest
As you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways
For my lovely Lady May

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy won't you look down over me
Yeah I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

[Verse 2]
Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis

They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green will be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer

[Verse 3]
Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said
"Tell me are you a Christian child?"
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight"

I'm walking in Memphis

Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis

Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
But Pancho met his match, you know
In the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes

And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness, I suppose

And Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
And where he got the bread to go
Ain't nobody knows

And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
So the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty, too
He just did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

And a few gray federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so wrong
Out of kindness, I suppose

Well my buckle makes impressions
On the inside of her thigh
There are little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd known she was religious
Then I wouldn't have came stoned
To the house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you
I said many folks have warned me
There's been several people try
But up till now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Verse 2]
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better

And all your tears that you have cried will go away

I guess I was born to be at war

Simbang gabi nanaman
Tayo gising na, patulog pa lang ang buwan
Ang simoy ng hangin

Dahan-dahang na humahaplos
Sa mukha ng bawat tao
Bumabagsak-bagsak pa ang mata

Dahan-dahang kumislap
Ang mga ilaw ng tumatandang simbahan
Kung san magkasama tayong nagdasal
At nakinig sa Misa de Gallo
Pagdating ng Ama Namin, ang oras huminto

Nang magkahawak ang ating mga kamay
Umawit mga ulap at sabay
Nagsiawit ang mga anghel sa langit
At nang unang gabi ng pasko'y sumapit
Kay ganda ng harana ng tinig
Na sumasabay sa ihip ng hangin
Ang sabi nila...
Ang sabi nila...

Pagkatapos magsimba
Habang hinahatid kita sa iyong tahanan
Parang walang katapusan ang ating kwentuhan
Tungkol sa mga buhay ng isa't isa, ako'y nahalina

Nang mapadaan tayo dun sa may tindahan
Umawit mga ulap at sabay
Nagsiawit ang mga anghel sa langit
At nang unang gabi ng pasko'y sumapit
Kay ganda ng harana ng tinig
Na sumasabay sa ihip ng hangin
Ang sabi nila...
Ang sabi nila...

Natapos din ang siyam na araw ng simbang gabi
Ang sabi ko sa sarili, baka ito na ang huli
Pero mula nung unang Ama Namin
Na ang iyong kamay ay hinawakan
Di mo na binitawan

Nagsiawit ang mga anghel sa langit
At nang unang gabi ng pasko'y sumapit
Kay ganda ng harana ng tinig
Na sumasabay sa ihip ng hangin
Ang sabi nila...
Ang sabi nila...
Oh ang sabi nila

Ang sabi nila
Bilhan mo na siya ng bibingka
Dahil ikaw na ang aking tadhana
Bilhan mo na siya ng bibingka
Dahil ikaw na ang aking tadhana

[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

[Verse 2: Kris Kristofferson]
I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

[Verse 3: Waylon Jennings]
I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around and around and around and
Around and around

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
I fly a star-ship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again

Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire

You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour

Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

Cut off the bottoms of my feet

Take me down to the police
Charge me with assault

She does what she wants to me

That's right and
She don't care what kind of wounds she's inflicted on me
She don't care what color bruises that she's leavin' on me
'Cause she's got freedom in the 21st century

Two black gadgets in her hands
All she thinks about
No responsibility no guilt or morals
Cloud her judgement
Smile on her face
She does what she damn well please

An' she don't care that what she does has an effect on you

As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying "stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

'Twas was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

Now there's some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'
And others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o

I think the universe is on my side
Heaven and earth have finally aligned
Days are good and that's the way it should be
You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case
It's like a moon beam brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing, "Ooh, la-la-la"
You make a girl go, "Ooh"
I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright

[Verse 2]
And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be

Please don't take my sunshine away

I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else dear, could come between
But now you've left me and love another

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, "I'm just another fool and this is just another song"
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time

Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do

Didn't want to let my freedom get
Too far away so I would say anything
To keep you just close enough

A little time for me to think
I just need you to wait for me
But you weren't waiting for me

To grow up, get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround, running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then
I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
'Cause I'm man enough now

[Verse 2]
I guess it's something that every boys gotta do
Getting so close to letting it slip through
Your fingers yeah, you gotta learn the hard way
Once you do you start to look back on
All the things that you should've, would've, could've done
Bet you never thought that I would

You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

[Chorus]
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends

We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight

You made a man this fragile
You made a heart that can break
You showed me the road less traveled
Knowin' I'm gonna run away
You make me love so hard
When everything I love just leaves
Are you sure there's nothing wrong with me?

And why does my life have to hurt so much?
Why can't I find any peace or love?
And why do I feel like I'm not enough?
Dear God, are you sure that you don't mess up?

Can we still call it praying if all that I do is sitting here cursing, cursing your name again?
The truth is it's not even you
It's just me that I'm up against
But you made me this
Can we share the blame for this? Mmm

There's nothing you don't make

I know you tell me there's nothing wrong with me

Yeah, but why does my life have to hurt so much?
And why can't I find any peace or love?
And why do I feel like I'm not enough?

[Verse 1]
There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

[Verse 2]
Till Armageddon no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

[Outro]
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him


Start of song 


[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Verse 1]
You see a girl in the hallway
And you whisper to your friend, "Who is she anyway?"
You forgot what she looks like in like a day
But your words don't hurt me
I will be okay

[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me
I'm not Clay

[Verse 2]
You see that girl in the hallway
Smile on her face as she walks away
Trying to tear her down was your first mistake
'Cause little do you know she wasn't built to break

[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me

[Bridge]
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not...
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not Clay

Your silly words
I won't live inside your world

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
90’s hits at the top of our lungs
Shuffle landed on "Still the One"
Missing turns 'cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold

Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?

[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"

Get ready to go crazy right here
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Verse 2]
I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee (That's right)
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Bridge 1]
Playin' hard to get are ya?
Let me tell ya a little more about ya, and why I love ya

[Verse 3]
Damn you're a looker
You're the cane, you're the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading (Ain't ya baby?)
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh 'til I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all my money on you all over this town

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at

You thought it was over?

[Bridge 2]
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at

I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
As the lights flickered and they failed
I had it all figured out

[Chorus]
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

[Verse 2]
I took a trip out to the frozen lake
And you felt so far away
But I could feel it washing over me
There's no escaping the harsh light of day

[Chorus]
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

[Bridge]
Stood out on that beach in Chicago
Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue
Wherever I went I always knew, always knew
'Til I didn't know

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun

[Letra de "Aerolínea Carrilo" ft. Gerardo Ortiz]

[Verso 1: Kristopher Nava & Gerardo Ortiz]
Como una parvada
Los aviones se miraban
Y entre el fuselaje
Viajaba la colombiana
Ellos así la transportaban
El radar no la detectaba
La colocaban con los güeros
Y los verdes les llegaban
Muy inteligente
Bueno pa' cerrar los tratos
Rusos, orientales, colombianos e italianos
Fuerte exponente en el mercado
Por eso fue de un alto mando
Su nombre fue Amado Carillo
Leyenda en el contrabando
En su mente vagaba una idea muy brillante
Meterles la coca en los aviones comerciales
Y su aerolínea se estrenaba
Y resultados ya se miraban
Kilo a kilito fue metiendo
Fueron muchas toneladas

[Interludio: Gerardo Ortiz & Kristopher Nava]
Y échele mi T3R Elemento, ¡ahí nomas!
Y así es mi compa Gera, y gang gang foo

[Verso 2: Gerardo Ortiz & Kristopher Nava]
Y de Pablo Emilio, el señor se ganó el respeto
Lo que producía lo movía con el viento
Era directo y sin escalas
En cinco días la merca entraba
Con eso construyó un imperio
Y su fortuna millonaria
Rey de oro blanco
Uno de tantos apodos
Controló el mercado
Y lo hizo a su modo
La discreción lo hizo grande
Y arregló con los generales
Doscientos millones de verdes
Y esos eran semanales
Surgen las preguntas con relación a su muerte
Que si falleció o que si es leyenda viviente
La nave 727, que recorrió los continentes
Tal vez sí sigue por los cielos
La duda queda pa' ustedes

[Outro: Sergio Cárdenas]
¡Y eso es todo compa Gera, puro pa'delante papá!

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus 1]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
Follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

That ain't no reason to stop

Start of song 


Early in the morning when the sun does rise
Layin' in the bed with bloodshot eyes
Late in the evenin' when the sun sinks low
That's about time my rooster crows
I got women up and down this creek
And they keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don't fret
Cause there ain't been one slow me down none yet

Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads

I got people try to tell me, Red
Keep this livin' and you'll wind up dead
Cast your troubles on the Lord of Lord's
Or wind up laying on a cooling board
But I got buddies up White House Road
And they keep me strutting when my feet hang low
Rotgut whiskey gonna ease my pain
'N all this runnin's gonna keep me sane

Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads

When you lay me in the cold hard clay
Won't ya sing them hymns while the banjo plays
You can tell them ladies that they ought not frown
Cause there ain't been nothing ever held me down
Lawmen, women or a shallow grave
Same ol' blues just a different day

Get me drinking' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the highwall
Throw'em in the river and get your fill
We been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street

[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w/ LL Cool J ad libs)]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Verse 4: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee
But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me
Know what I mean?) It's real, it's real
It's truth

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

And the flames went higher

Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and

I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and

You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else", how could you do this, babe?

Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it

How could you do this, babe?

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same

[Verse 2]
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings...
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...

Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but

When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down

And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

But who am I supposed to talk to?

It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because

I don't know, I just miss you so much
Can you call me back?"

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

For me, it happens all the time

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset

I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch
Huh?

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline

Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band

Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap

And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me

Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead

[Verse 2]
I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would

Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days

[Verse 4]
When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel

[Chorus 2]
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die

Man, you got it all worked out
Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 3]
I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican

[Chorus]
Oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through

Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl

Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed "space" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight, but

I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand
And "No" was all he said

I went looking for a place to hide

But my friend can stick around"

The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what."

"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done."

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been."
And he played:

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no

On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

Baby, you can go or you can stay

You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

The wind began to howl

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

Away (away)
What if?

[Verse 1]
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 2]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 3]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 4]
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Hook]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 1]
Yeah I know that the woes and the weight of the world
Can get in side our minds and be too much sometimes, I know
But baby don't let the no's and the ups and the downs
From the roller coaster ride beat you up inside, baby don't
But if you ever feel that way, don't you ever hesitate, cause

[Chorus]
You got my number you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Said let, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Put it all on me

[Verse 2]
Wanna take you out on the town on my dime anytime, tell me when you're free
We can do anything and everything you want yeah
Oh I wanna hear all your fears and your troubles
Strip it down, really get to know one another
When it's nobody but you and me just us
Girl you know I'm here for you
You can lean on me anytime you need to

[Chorus]
You got my number, you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Said let, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me
Baby put it all on me
Girl put it all on me

[Bridge]
C'mon relax your mind on me
When you need a shoulder you can cry on me
Baby you can bet your life on me
Put it all on me

[Chorus]
You got my number, you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me
When it don't add up you can count on me
When you're low come get high on me
Make it slow take your time on me
Said let, let it out
Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me

Yeah baby put it all on me, yeah

Start of song 


Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me through everythin' I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She was lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' left was all she left to me
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

[Outro]
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Better man

[Verse 1]
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 2]
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 3]
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now

I can’t use it anymore

I feel I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door

I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down

[Verse 1]
American by birth and Southern by the grace of God
Means that everything I do, I do it right
New York and California, you can go and have your fun
But down here I got a list of what I like

[Chorus 1]
Eating tater tots and pussy
Sucking Mountain Dew and tits
Kick my grandpa in his nutsack
Then I suck my boss' dick
Fuck my cousin in her asshole 'fore I finished on her tits
Then I shoot my neighbor's cat
I love that redneck shit

[Verse 2]
You can make your jokes at us and giggle all you want
But my friends and me man, we don't give a lick
If you can read this then the bitch fell off, that's a sticker on a bike
Sure, but it's also a tattoo inked on my dick

[Chorus 2]
Taking pictures of my momma while she's tryna take a shit
Then I'm throwing rocks at cripples and I laugh when they get hit
Pull my pecker out at Wal-Mart then I pop my sister's zits
Jacking off my neighbor's dog
I love that redneck shit

[Verse 3]
People think we're crazy man, they think we're all insane
Take a visit and I swear you'll never leave
You can stay at grandma's house, she'll cook you up some country ham
And after dinner you can nibble on her beave'

[Chorus 3]
Met a biddie at the swap meet then I fucked her for a bit
Shoved a dildo up my asshole just to see if it could fit
Buy a bunch of nudie magazines, the ones that show the clit
Then I tongue my brother’s butt
I love that redneck shit
Redneck shit!


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy

I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Verse 2]
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven

You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'

[Intro]
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 3]
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 1]
Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Refrain]
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it

Hangin' on the words you say

Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby

Well lord, I thought I would cry

She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm In love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
And I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving
This is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues, oh lord
Since my baby say goodbye

And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love

Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry

Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

Liquor was the only love I'd known

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs

You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

What it's doin' to me ain't a secret

After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room

Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Spoken Verse 1]
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Spoken Verse 2]
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Bridge]
Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town

Well, Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving

But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say, boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem & Yelawolf]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

[Verse 1]
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Verse 2]
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Bridge]
The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't want to wake up
In this burning house

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water

Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich

Would just turn into dollar signs

With every guitar string scar on my hand

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
A ride-or-die, dollar six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?

Start of song 


You said you don’t wanna die but still you want to go to heaven
Heaven’s not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin’ what is keeping you from walkin’ out the door and livin’ life like there’s a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya’ they will loot ya’ they are killin’
Killin’ power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it’s a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they’re givin’

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat

They marchin’ up the street they wanna fight they don’t want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin’ guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they’ll execute if you don’t leave
Leavin’ the impression no one’s safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin’ poison to the junkies - to a junkie it’s a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that’s on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin’ hammers, ridin’ horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat

[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

[Verse 2]
You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy

[Bridge]
It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

[Outro]
But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
We met in a parking lot
I was buying coffee and cigarettes
Firewood and bad wine long since gone
But I'm still drunk and hot
Wide awake and breathing hard
Now, in just one year's time
I've become jealous, rail-thin, prone to paranoia when I'm stoned
If this isn't true love, someone oughta put me in a home
Say, do you wanna get married?
And put an end to our endless progressive tendency to scorn
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your Daddy's farm
For love to find us of all people
I never thought it'd be so simple

[Verse 2]
Let's buy a plantation house
And let the yard grow wild until we don't need the signs that say, "Keep out"
I've got some money left and it's cheaper in the South
I need someone I can trust
To protect me from our seven daughters when my body says "enough"
Don't let me die in a hospital
I'll save the big one for the last time we make love
Insert here:
A sentiment re: our golden years
All cause I went to the store one day
"I've seen you around, what's your name?"


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 2]
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing "Closing Time" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbor’s cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

[Chorus]
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home

[Chorus 2]
You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you

[Chorus 1]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

[Chorus 1]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies
Ooh, mmm, mmm

[Chorus 2]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly

Daylight, woah daylight
Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend

[Verse 1]
Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?

[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' 'til I'm heavily faded
All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated
I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man

[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

Throw that bottle of whiskey under the seat
Light a cigarette so he don't smell the weed
If he asks me to blow I'mma tell his punk ass to take me to jail
I've been here time and time before
Rocky Mountains to Midway with every whore
In a 25 mile circumference of this damned ole town

I can't hold it will you turn the music up?
And let's play critter critter

Last night was crazy and
There ain't a dent in my truck so we're golden Lord
We wanna thank you again
For watchin' over us when all we do is sin
Let's go to Mr. J's buy another case
Pack of cigarettes and be on our way
Back to the boneyard
Oh dear Lord

Enough to take me to taco bell

Will somebody take me to taco bell?

Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it
You can try to fake it

Hei, hidup hanya numpang ketawa
Aku tertawa, maka ku apa?
Hei, hidup hanya numpang ketawa
Aku tertawa, maka ku apa?

[Verse 1]
Britney Spears dan Pevita Pearce
Lari lebih kencang dari Nazaruddin
Oh panggilin Hotman Paris
Karena ternyata oh the police
Sudah sampai di depan gang
Di Sayidan
Samping Apotik Kaliasin
Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
Waktu itu langit sedang kasmaran
Hei, buktinya berwarna jingga
Dan menyanyikan pesan tentang aku
Lalu kulihat sore sedang asyik-asyiknya
Menubruk kopi, mencumbu senja di batas kata
Mereka bertanya
"Hari ini hari apa?"
"Green Day kah atau Pure Saturday kah?"
Hei hei hei, hari ini Monday
Jawab Abdul Sang Pelayan dari warung kopi
Sore ngambek, lalu pergi tanpa pesan
Sementara Robby Darwis mengirim umpan lambung jarak jauh kepada Harry Pochang
Yang kemudian merespon dengan tendangan salto
Bola melintir, blowing in the wind
Bola menyenggol Jagoan Neon
Bir dicampur freon
Gitar listrik menyalak
Harmonika melantunkan
Ayah
Me terkenang ayat
Lalu ku teringat kepada mayat
Yang hak-haknya dirampas hanya karena perbedaan pendapat

Hei, hidup hanya numpang ketawa
Aku tertawa, maka ku apa?
Hei, hidup hanya numpang ketawa
Aku tertawa, maka ku apa?

[Verse 3]
"Senandung Maaf" lagu tak bertuan
Kembali kita kepada alam
Di mana Britney dan Pevita dinyatakan hilang
GPS telat bangun
CCTV sibuk manggung
Netizen kebingungan 2 x 24 jam sang idola absen dari Instagram
Aw, Aw
Lalu dari balik kerumunan
Kulihat seorang wartawan
Menyelinap, merayap, mendekat
Bagaikan ninja ia merapat
Dengan kamera di tangan
Ia bertanya
"Wahai netizen bajingan"
"Apakah ada firasat sebelum idola kamu menghilang?"
Netizen kebingungan, tetangga ketularan
Tak tahu apa yang harus dilakukan
Maka mereka pun bernyanyi

[Bridge]
Kuambil gele sebatang
Ucapkan puji Tuhan
Kuhisap dalam-dalam dengan teman
Rasanya melayang-melayang
Tik, tik, tik
Bunyi padi di atas genting
Wanginya tidak terkira
Cobalah, Teman, lihat ke sana
Semua manusia makan semua
Potong bebek angsa, masak di kuali
Campur kuah ganja, rakyat senang sekali
Oper ke kiri, oper ke kanan
Do re mi la la do Remy Sylado

I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

[Chorus]
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old (never grow old)
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks

[Verse 1]
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 4]
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again"
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Un Cereal Milk de la Cookies que ahora es medicinal
Las vibras del papel me hicieron levantar
Con el humo que aviento todo esto se va a soltar
El Chivo ahora aquí está, la quarter está de más
Me pasa el toque, la devuelve y todo está normal (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Berner]
We pull it fresh off the branch
Smoking out the pound bag while these clear stones dance (Too many dancin')
Weed from Northern California but my papers are from France (We smokin' lots)
Had to go big, fuck it, you only get one chance (You only get one chance)
Why they call me El Chivo? 'Cause I feed all my people (El Chivo)
Been rich since nine-six, 'fore the weed went legal (Bags)
Big farms, new cars, and a few jars
The Cereal Milk taste so crazy I'ma need more (Receipts)
Yeah, I just opened up a weed store (Weed store)
Blue bags got your boy in a weed war (I'm in a weed war)
Kris, they ain't smoking like this (Nah)
The Gelato with the mints, that's a hell of a mix, damn

Dog, this shit smell like candy (Like candy)
In the cut, rollin' up, getting high with my family (With my family)
In the Andes, lookin' for the seeds they grew in the '60's (I'm in Columbia)
All this smoke in the studio, it got your boy dizzy (It got me dizzy)
I got bags in my trunk, where the glow tray? (Glow tray)
Groupie girls in my show wanna role play (Get my drama on)
I'm so paid I eat steak on a gold plate
My watch look like a block full of snowflake
Grow something if you got it
The Cello got us right, the whole world want it (Damn)
Kris, they ain't smokin' like this
The Cheetah Piss got me lazy as shit, ha

Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Hook]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go

He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
He said, "Hi, what's new?"
And Wo said, "Sit down I got some bad news that's going to hurt"

[Verse 2]
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 3]
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far - you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun

[Verse 4]
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake

[Chorus 2]
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot, just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"

[Verse 5]
The judge said "guilty" on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it"

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 6]
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my

It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’

It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got

[Spoken Intro]

I've seen Jesus play with flames
In a lake of fire that I was standing in
Met the devil in Seattle
And spent 9 months inside the lions den
Met Buddha yet another time
And he showed me a glowing light within
But I swear that God is there
Every time I glare in the eyes of my best friend

Says my son, "It's all been done
And someday you're gonna wake up old and gray
So go and try to have some fun
Showing warmth to everyone
You meet and greet and cheat along the way"

There's a gateway in our minds
That leads somewhere out there, far beyond this plane
Where reptile aliens made of light
Cut you open and pull out all your pain
Tell me how you make illegal
Something that we all make in our brain
Some say you might go crazy
But then again it might make you go sane

Every time I take a look
Inside that old and fabled book
I'm blinded and reminded of
The pain caused by some old man in the sky
Marijuana, LSD
Psilocybin, and DMT
They all changed the way I see
But love's the only thing that ever saved my life

So don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes
Or fairy tales of blood and wine
It's turtles all the way down the line
So to each their own 'til we go home
To other realms our souls must roam
To and through the myth that we all call space and time

More times than I can count
But that don't matter now

'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you

But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 1]
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

[Verse 2]
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"

[Verse 3]
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right"

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

[Verse 4]
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

[Verse 5]
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table

You can bet when I hear, "Congratulations"
Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Ooh, famous for lovin' you, ooh
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
And if I'm gonna go down in history
I hope it's all 'cause of you and me
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin’
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

[Verse 2]
The morning’s a cross I bear when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late to...

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
Cause the devil's forever in my veins

The devil's forever in my veins

I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right

[Verse 2]
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

I’ve been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find

I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was havin' some fun

I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby

Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall

It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby

Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of the Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) music's gone
Gone

They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me

Me pelan la verga todos
Llegó su compa, Ezequiel, vámonos, El Machiwi
Saca el perico, compa, artesanal, de Culiacán

[Verso]
Tengo 7 Hummers, una arriba de la otra
Pero me falta su boca, esa que a mí me provoca
Tengo ocho millones, sólo en estos pantalones
Pero nunca en mi cara, has restregado tus calzones
Tengo un lanzallamas, pero tú ya no me llamas
Tengo una bazuca, pero no eres mi ruca

[Coro]
Ando periqueado, soy un chico enamorado
De tu culito operado, y tu busto arremangado
Ando bien loco, es que a mí me gusta el foco
Y tus labios tan carnosos, me resultan deliciosos
Un chico enamorado

How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 2]
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 3]
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

[Chorus]
I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

[Verse 2]
If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight

[Bridge]
They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me

And I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'

Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Bridge]
Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

[Outro]
It'll all be alright

[Intro]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Post-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh

[Verse 1]
You think that you know my heart
And you probably do
That's why I'm always with you
I could stay with you for hours
In an empty room
Never get bored
Never have nothing to do

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my other half
You're what makes me, me
What makes me smile
When I fall down and can't get back, get back, get back up
On my feet
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

[Chorus]
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
We can find the rainbow
Up in the sky
You'd say don't you cry, it's all gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
If we ever got into a fight or war that would be bad
Cause you know all of my secrets
But I know all of yours
We make hours into seconds together
The weight of the world feel like a feather
Cause we're holding it right in our hands

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my other half
What makes me, me
What makes me smile
When I fall down and can't get back, get back, get back up on my feet
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

[Bridge]
You and me together
We'll forget what we have been told
We'll live in our own dream world
You and me forever
We'll forget what we have been told
We will take on the whole world

[Pre-Chorus]
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

[Verse 2]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see ya' make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

[Verse 3]
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you

[Verse 4]
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead

[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time

I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears

Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
That you're worn down from fighting for me
A real man knows what he's signing up for
And if you don't then I'll show myself the door

[Chorus]
Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it

[Verse 2]
Is it too much to look me in the eye
And listen to what I'm saying this time
I'm so tired of being up on your shelf
And if that's what you want
You want somebody else

[Chorus]
Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it
Cause I know I'm worth it (worth it)

Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
You should be begging down on your knees

Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar

Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
I never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

(Chorus)
Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home

And sing a little love song
My love, to myself
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That what I say
No one's got to listen to
The words in my head
Someone hit the big score
And I figured it out
And I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

Close the curtains, cash me in
Gather photographs of the Devil you let in
Digging deep inside my soul
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]
Where to turn
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die? Is it time to close my eyes? (My eyes, my eyes)

[Verse 2]
Keep me numb, I'll follow direction
A pawn to pass around and be bled until I'm dry
It's hard to see what's underneath
Is it me? Is it me?

[Chorus]
Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run?
Or lay down and die? Is it time to close my eyes?

[Bridge]
For so long all I've known, all I've seen's green lights
Fuck your greed, all I need's somewhere
To catch my breath, rest my head and ease my mind
I've been holding on, but my grip ain't what it used to be
I'm much older, I'm bitter, I'm jaded, I'm lost
Can somebody give me a sign?

[Chorus]
Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die? Is it time to close my eyes?
Where do I turn?
Everywhere I look, these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die? Is it time to close my eyes?

My temper got the best of me
And when I said that I mean I know every single thing that I said was true
And I know that you're mad at me
But if you're thinkin' like that, I think you'll see that you're mad at you too
And I know the feelin's strong
Strong enough to forget about all that I've been through
And it sounds obscene, but
Loud words never bothered me like they do to you

You're the boy that talks but says nothin'
A big game to the ones that you think'll believe you, yeah
But you don't know how to read
The look on my face when it says, "Yeah, I've read that book too"
And who the hell's impressed by you?
I want names of the people that we know that are fallin' for this
You would sell your own mother out
And then betray your dead brother with another hypocritical kiss


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
A love song was playing on the radio
It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you
And I wonder how you're doing but I wish I didn't care
Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you

[Chorus]
By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

[Verse 2]
Didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading
Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

[Chorus]
By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

[Verse 3]
When I woke up in the morning I was choking on some words
There were things unsaid between us, there were things you never told
Now that's twice you broke my heart now, the first was way back when
And to know you're still unhappy only makes it break again

[Chorus]
By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine

By the way, I forgive you
I never will, never will forget you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Ooh, ooh, hmm

Ah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling never sad, so fine

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Verse 2]
Well if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

La la la
Come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed Merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What you're missing, messin' 'round them brick walls

[Verse 3]
So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?

And I'm going to Carolina in my mind

Karen she's the silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shine
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

[Verse 2]
There ain't no doubt in no one's mind
That love's the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey, baby - the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I?
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

[Chorus]
In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
When I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

[Verse 3]
Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway calling
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
The signs that might be omens say I'm going, going
I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

[Verse 4]
Now it's a holy host of others standing around me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it seems like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind

[Chorus]
In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?
Yes I'm gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm gone to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Now can't you just feel the moonshine?
And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind?

Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, "We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind"

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, "If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm"

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, "It's time to go"
Doctor says, "The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

There's a rumor going round about me and you

What d'you say we make it true, baby?

Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?

[Intro]
Hello, my son
Welcome to earth
You may not be my last
But you'll always be my first
Wish I'd done this ten years ago
But how could I know
How could I know
That the answer was so easy
I've been told you measure a man
By how much he loves
When I hold you
I treasure each moment I spend
On this earth, under heaven above
Grandfather always said God's a fisherman
And now I know the reason why

[Verse]
And if some times daddy has to go away
Well please don't think it means I don't love you
Oh, how I wish I could be there everyday
'Cause when I'm gone it makes me so sad and blue
And holding you is the greatest love I've ever known
When I get home it breaks my heart
Seeing how much you've grown all on your own
Oh

[Outro]
Oh, hearing you cry makes me cry
It made me cry
Hearing me cry
A thousand miles away
Every cry
(Greatest love I've ever known)
(Ever known)

They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Outro]
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

[Verse 2]
The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

[Verse 3]
The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living still

[Verse 1]
"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,"
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus Variation]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark

My boss, man, he's such a jerk
So after work I went to his house
Ate his wife's pussy and kicked his ass

Monday morning I got laid off
So I celebrated with some alcohol
Standing in the unemployment line
I see this young girl's bush and said, "it's breakfast time"
Security Guard said, "you can't do that here"
So I kicked him in the nuts before I drank a beer
Girl at the counter said, "do you want a job?"
And I said, "okay" and then I ate her pussy

Thursday night I was feeling pretty great
I was walking past the honkeytonk on broadway
I see this young girl, she's smilin' at me
So I took her back to my place and I paid her fee
Took off her skirt, I knew that somethin' was wrong
Where there's supposed to be a pussy this girl had a dong
I was bored and since I'd paid anyway
I sucked his dick and then I kicked his ass

And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow

Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

On the golden streets of the great wide valley
These old chains around my feet

The grave and the garden won't be satisfied

As I lie in the wake of time's cruel slaughter
But if I die before I wake

You kiss my lips like you mean it, but you ain't that slick

Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal, you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see

So that's why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house
And he can wonder where you are
Well, you're right here looking sexy, whispering in my ear

Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down

I just want your ex to see, ex to see, ex to see

What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...

Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab
So let's go...

[Chorus: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Bridge: Together (Karen Fairchild) Luke Bryan]
It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me
So let's go...

[Chorus: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget

Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

Home alone tonight

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I have never known the likes of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon

[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up

A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
Days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
Till someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One I'd never seen till you came along

So girl, hang your dress up to dry
We ain't leaving this room
Till Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on the Stones
Like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
Till someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Verse 1]
There's a jersey on the wall
In a high school gym in my hometown
In the corner by the scoreboard
Where the bleacher seats fold down
27 took the Tigers to the finals that year
But that's not why it's hanging there

[Chorus]
If I ever get to Heaven
You know I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
And why can't You stop a car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking

[Verse 2]
I bet, somewhere, there's a yearbook
In a box under a bed
With a senior picture missing
"In Loving Memory" instead
And somewhere there's a mother
Who stopped going to church
'Cause Your plan quit making sense down here on Earth

[Chorus]
If I ever get to Heaven
You know I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
Why couldn't You stop that car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm just saying
You don't have to answer now
Oh, but someday

[Chorus]
If I ever get to Heaven
I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
If You got Your hands on everything that happens
Then why couldn't You stop that car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking
I'm just asking

I'm a working bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
You wish you could sway my attention
I'm working, bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
Sure as fuck can't sway my attention

[Verse 1]
Too tired to entertain little boys
I'm the boss of my business, I should invoice, and
One strike, two, I'm self-employed
Swear my blue vibrator brings me more joy
If you wanna play second fiddle to my job
Wanna be side-dick in a one-stop shop
Let me know, huh
Let me know, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do well for myself, nothing you do is extraordinary
Taxing on my mental health and my last boyfriend was cautionary

I love my, I love my, I love my, I love my
I love my day job, fuck a blowjob, what's the point?
It's all déjà vu, they don't give me what I want
Money, make some, makin' money better than the dick
Pussy Play-Doh, pussy like her pockets, thick
Now he look stressed 'cause he know that I don't need him
Mouth open, baby bird, I'm not gonna feed him
Yeah, I'm big, I'm boss

It's perfect outside, it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it; better stop and take it in' kind of scenes
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing

[Chorus]
You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
(You should be here)

[Verse 2]
You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone
Showin' 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face

You should be here
Standin' with your arm around me here

You'd be lovin' this
You'd be freakin' out
You'd be smilin'

Yeah we're all lonely together

I want to share your sin
I want to be your blood
And I want to be let in
Don't you just
Don't we all just
Want to be together

Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy

If your face is down
Take a look around
Do your fingers move?
Do your lungs inflate?
Are you tired, are you weary
Of the hidden hate you've been holding?
And did you lose that love?
Or have you never had it?
Are you feeling sad 'cause you did a bad thing?

Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind

Are you feeling fearful sister?
The only way to lose that fearful feeling
Replace it with love that's healing
Are you feeling fearful brother?
Are you feeling fearful sister?

Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

[Verse 2: TJ Osborne]
I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am

Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Woo!

Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone

I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?

[Verse 2]
I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine?

[Bridge]
I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind?

Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus]
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 2]
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Chorus]
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Bridge]
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 1]
Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year
He'd buy a hundred pound of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine

Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
It's before my time but I've been told
He never came back from Copperhead Road

[Verse 2]
Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound

Then the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

[Verse 3]
I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first, 'round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
And I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road

And now the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie don't you know
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I'm sorry, ma'am, don't hang up
Nah, I ain't selling nothing
I don't know what I was thinking when I called
I guess I wasn't
Yeah, I was just down on my luck
Having some trouble with this ol' truck
And the guy that used to pick up
He could fix anything

[Chorus]
Sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number

[Verse 2]
I learned it by heart when I was 6
He never did change it
I've called it in trouble
With good and bad news
And break-ups, yeah, you name it
Sure, I've got some friends I can call
They're always there if I need to talk
But good as they are, it ain't their fault
Sometimes I just need him

[Chorus]
And sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number

[Bridge]
So I apologize in advance
'Cause there's a damn good chance
When I meet that girl
Get that job
And I need to tell my best friend
You're probably gonna hear from me again

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups

So I guess it's over, baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

That's right
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 1]
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

[Verse 2]
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 3]
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 4]
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look, old yella's leavin'"
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, "This one's for Becky" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

[Chorus 2]
I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

[Verse 1]
You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

[Chorus x 2]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who

Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning

Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

[Verse 2]
Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations

The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river

If you'll be my star, I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me and come out at night
When I turn jet black and you show off your light

But you can skyrocket away from me
And never come back if you find another galaxy
Far from here with more room to fly
Just leave me your stardust to remember you by

[Verse:]
If you'll be my boat, I'll be your sea
A depth of pure blue just to probe curiosity
Ebbing and flowing and pushed by a breeze
I live to make you free, I live to make you free

But you can set sail to the west if you want to
And past the horizon, 'til I can’t even see you
Far from here where the beaches are wide
Just leave me your wake to remember you by

If you'll be my star, I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me and come out at night

Your suitcase is gone, with all of your things
Our old picture frames are empty
I burned all your letters, I took off your ring
But what can I do with these memories
Keeping me up 'til the dawn, hanging on like you're coming back
But you ain't coming back

[Chorus]
So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
I try try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes when I kiss his lips
Praying this time I will see you
I'm real good at lying to everyone else
But I just can't lie to myself
When the truth is a shadow that follows me
Haunting me just like a ghost, if you're just a ghost

So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
I try try, baby, try, baby, try

Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

I saw your taillights fade into the dark
And my head knows but there's no convincing my heart

I try try, baby, try, baby, try

Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry

It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer

I had my dream, I held your hand on that broad avenue
We crossed the road and never spoke to another as we flew
We left your man alone in drag, laughin' there at us
A romantic bust, a blundered turn, explosive blunderbuss

An ancient grand hotel of Persian thread and ivory
And when your man would turn his head, I'd see you look at me
Pools of brown and sea of red an' demons in your pocket
That same romance performed a dance inside a silver locket

Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da

Corner exit, not tall enough to walk out standin' straight
Designed by men so ladies would have to lean back in their gait
You grabbed my arm and left with me but you were not allowed to
You took me to a public place to quietly blend into
Such a trick pretendin' not to be doin' what you want to
But seems like everybody does this every waking moment

I laid you down and touched you like the two of us both needed
Safe to say that others might not approve of this and pleaded
"So selfish, them" would be their cry and who'd be brave to argue
Doin' what two people need is never on the menu

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the "Gales of November" came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And ev'ry man knew, as the captain did too
'twas the "Witch of November" come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the Gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came the old cook came on deck sayin'
"Fellas, it's too rough t'feed ya"
At seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in; he said
"Fellas, it's bin good t'know ya!"

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er

They might have split up or they might have capsized;
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the Gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the "Maritime Sailors' Cathedral"
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
"Superior," they said, "never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early!"

All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Verse 2: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Bridge: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Verse 1]
Somehow, we've always been together
But never got together
I never felt the pressure 'til now
There's something in the air
I'm here and you're just there
I can't pretend that I don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

[Post-Chorus]
For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling

[Verse 2]
One risk from lying on your shoulder
When I was feeling colder
And now I can't get over
One kiss, a dangerous situation
I'm lost in hesitation
My heart's a little shaken

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, one day, I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling

Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling

[Verse 1]
I couldn't be happy in the city at night
You can't see the stars from the neon light
Sidewalk's dirty and the river's worse
The underground trains all run in reverse
Nobody here can dance like me
Everybody clapping on the one and the three
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

[Verse 2]
So many people with so much to do
The winter's so cold my hands turn blue
Old men sleeping on the filthy ground
They spend their whole day just walking around
Nobody else here seems to care
They walk right past them like they ain't even there
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

[Chorus 1]
Daddy said the river would always lead me home
But the river can't take me back in time and daddy's dead and gone
The family farm's a parking lot for Walton's five and dime
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

[Verse 3]
I tried to go to college but I didn't belong
Everything I said was either funny or wrong
They laughed at my boots, laughed at my jeans
Laughed when they gave me amphetamines
Left me alone in a bad part of town
Thirty-six hours to come back down
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

[Chorus 2]
Mama says God won't give you too much to bear
That might be true in Arkansas but I'm a long, long way from there
That whole world's an old and faded picture in my mind
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Brianna Harness]
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company

[Verse 1: Struggle Jennings]
Tear drops on your eye lids
'Cause you worried about the life I live
Can't change my ways, I done tried before
Try to make you laugh but you cry more
At war with my own soul
On this road it's been so cold
But our love burns like a hot coal
I'm afraid the flame's gon' swallow you
Die for you, and I'd kill for you
But I don't think you know what I feel for you
To be real with you, I've got issues
You don't deserve to be put through
I could lie, say I'll put you first
But I never will, Outlaw's Curse
And you're worth more, but you'll hurt more
If you stick around, so whats worse?
Not the knight that you searched for
No white horse and no shiny armor
Come equipped with a broken heart
Bunch of crazy love and some bad karma
Know I'll never find a better love
And I don't think that I could ever measure up
Weigh my options on a broken scale
See the fast life will bring a slow hell

[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Brianna Harness]
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company

[Verse 2: Brianna Harness]
I know your life and I've signed up
Be by your side when times get tough
If you run away, I'll chase you
Our happiness is so near
We're growin' love with no fear
I'll never turn my back, to face you

You're a lot of fun, you're young and
Good lookin' too
And I don't mind at all waking up next to you
We've been running around
The past few weeks
'til you stopped one night and said to me
Where are we, and where's this goin'
I rolled over and said I don't know
Why we gotta put a label on somethin'
You said grow up and walked out my door

[Chorus]
Sorry darlin' if I've been a little gun-shy
There ain't nothin' wrong with you
It just scares me to death layin' by your side
After what the last one put me through
You'd be gun-shy too

[Verse 2]
Now you're mad as hell, got that half ton wound tight
Already decided that you're drinkin' tonight
Don't really feel like this is all on me
Hell I told you the truth and I set you free

Sorry darlin' if I've been a little gun-shy

I'm just sayin' not right now

With that jaded, faded, junky nurse - oh what pleasant company

Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an Interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks that he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says
"Hey darlin', I can remember when
You could stop a clock."

There's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station
He's got greasy hair, greasy smile
He says, "Lord this must be my destination."
Cause they told me when I was younger
"Boy you're gonna be president."
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went

What do they know know know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico

But they ain't no big deal
Cause the simple man baby pays for the thrills, the bills
The pills that kill

Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I could never explain

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many mile, mile, mile

Now baby you know you ain't doin' me right don'tcha
She say you don't see why, whoooo

So deep down in the ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone
You may bury my body, whoooo
Down by the highway side

Can get a Greyhound bus and ride

Tryin' to jump up out of your chest

Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

[Verse 2]
The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind that found us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head

[Chorus]
And I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

[Bridge]
I'm tuned in to you, something's on your mind, ain't it?
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames

[Chorus]
Girl I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

Ja te znam
(Da, da)

[Verse 1]
Ja te znam
Svaki dio tvog tijela
Mi smo k'o slika i ram na zidu
I nije me sram
Bio sam i gledam
Samo da ti dam što oni nisu
Voziš ko Phantom
Iznutra i s' vana
I voliš kada ti dam to, k'o niko nikada
Massimo Dutti, majica preko gun-a
A ti moja, u žutim tajicama pijana

Ne zanima je veza, malo bi se zezala
Malo je kontraverzna, pogledom me svezala
Izaziva, ne preza, loži ne bi prestala

I’ve been traveling
Flying on south again
How, how could it be
It seems as though a moment ago
I was reaping the seeds that I’d sewn

Now morning blows quickly through
Afternoon follows suit
How am I to get these things done?
Well time stays uncounted by days
A looming and ominous shade

Worry been breaking and bringing me down
And counting all the times that I fall
But when my time comes I won’t be counting at all
I feel all my filth when I look in your eyes
But it falls as light as a feather in the night

Man you said meet me there
How do get from here to where I belong?
It ain’t just like finding a sign to get home
It’s building your house on the stone

Worry been breaking and bringing me down
And counting all the times that I fall
But when my time comes I won’t be counting at all
I feel all my filth when I look in your eyes
But it falls as light as a feather in the night

Your house it will cover you
But the rain still falls outside
And your light it don’t shine cause it’s hidden under a bed
Why do you hide under a bed?

Bring your hands, close together

[Verse: 1]
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

[Verse: 2]
Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

[Verse: 3]
Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

[Verse: 4]
Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

[Verse: 5]
Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

There will be days
When the sun won't shine
When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid
Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

[Chorus]
'Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

[Verse 2]
There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea
Never to be found
Just know in your heart
That we're always together
And long after I'm gone
I'll still be around
'Cause our bond is eternal
And so is love
God is inside you
All around you
And up above
Growing, showing, you the way

A gang of kids on their peddle bikes
In a dusty town, way to ride
To the general store for popeye cigarettes
Class of ’99
Yeah we lived, laughed, loved and cried
Took for granted that those days would never end
Living like that yearbook picture wouldn’t fade
And some standing right beside me, I might never see again

[Chorus]
The trouble is
You think you have time
You think tomorrows always coming down the line
And then one day
You wake up and you find
The trouble is you thought you had time

[Verse 2]
Student hire and a fancy job
Big old house, two car garage
He works hard for his wife and his son
An empty seat at t-ball games
Just a sacrifice he’ll make
Make it up, next weekend comes along
Years go by and that day comes too soon
That boy goes off to college, he stands in his empty room

[Chorus]
The trouble is
You think you have time
You think tomorrows always coming down the line
And then one day
You wake up and you find
The trouble is you thought you had time

[Verse 3]
Shotgun shells and a tackle box
On the floorboard of a truck
Morning sun burning fog off a lake
Teenage girl and her grandad
He takes her fishing but he feels bad
She can't take her eyes off that Facebook page
But someday soon, who knows how long
She’ll look up from that phone and he’ll be gone

Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carryin' this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down
Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

What comes next
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine
Brighter than all we left behind

In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff (three... two... one)

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change

Ooh-ooh, watch it spinnin'
And ooh-ooh, jump right in an'
And ooh-ooh, let's begin
And we can see, don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change

No, there ain't nothing that I gotta prove
You think your words will make me black and blue
But I, I think I'm pretty with these old boots on
I think it's funny when I drink too much, hey
You try and change me, you can go to hell
Cause I don't want to be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe

So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock and roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight

What do you want from me? I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me, I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they say I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me, I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway

[Verse 2]
My hands are dirty and my heart is cold
The boys I've been with say I got no soul
When I, I meet another honey at the bar
I'll think it's funny when I break his heart, mmm now
My kind of medicine is whiskey straight
I got a mouth to put you in your place
And they, they said I'll never be the poster type
But they don't make posters of my kind of life

So kick out the jams, kick up the soul

Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

[Verse 2]
Ah one time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee
Well it's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

[Verse 3]
I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
Ah she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
Well I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
It seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

[Verse 4]
Then a friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee
And it's two long years, a-waitin' 'round to die

[Verse 5]
Ah but now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
Ah his name is codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Well together we're gonna wait around and die
Yeah together we're gonna wait around and die

Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't

We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave, cause I know

Then I give it all up for that little blue pill
That promises to bring it all back to you again

Ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Verse 2]
Here in the canyons above Sunset, the desert don't give up the fight
A coyote with someone’s Chihuahua in its teeth skitters 'cross my veranda in the night
Some lost sheep from Oklahoma sips her Mojito down at the Whiskey Bar
Smiles and says she thinks she remembers me from that commercial with the credit card

Hell, these days there ain't no more, now there’s just again
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

Some days I take my El Camino, throw my saddle in and go
East to the desert where the charros, they still ride and rope
Our American brothers cross the wire and bring the old ways with them
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again

[Verse 4]
Once I was shot by John Wayne, yeah, it was towards the end
That one scene's bought me a thousand drinks, set me up and tell it for you, friend
Here's to the cowboys, riders in the whirlwind
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
And the western stars are shining bright again

And the western stars are shining bright again

At least make it feel like night
Put on some this or that
And maybe I won't feel so bad
Need a little background noise
To drown out this little voice
Running circles 'round my brain
Screaming louder than the pain

My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you

[Verse 2: Susan Tedeschi]
Turn off the bedroom light
Put on a brave face and face the night
It's either get used to this dread
Or the cold spot in our bed
The bottle helps, but the memory burns
The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn
I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
Wake up tired and try again

[Chorus: Both]
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart

Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed?


Start of song 


Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home

What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, ind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you've been well
Me? I'm doin' alright, could always be better
Seein' as your the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today

[Verse 1]
If I could make a living from walking in the woods
You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

[Verse 2]
I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

[Chorus]
We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

[Bridge]
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Come on

Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"

I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, "Well-a bless my soul!"

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 3]
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane break by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 4]
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 1]
Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Verse 2]
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

[Chorus]
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Break]
Oo, oo

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Break]
Oo, oo

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
Hey, I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Intro: Music Video Only]
I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Post-Chorus]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

I got drunk, you got drunk
We had sex, we woke up
Caught up in a thread count, tangled in skin
Now you're checking your phone, he's checking in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it's right now that I start to see it
All of the weight of the way that it is
Caught between what it means to start over
And what happens over and over again, but

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
I'll cut you loose, baby, fly away
I'm holding on to what we had
But I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you back

[Verse 2]
I get up, you get up
We get dressed, say I love you
Kiss you goodbye and I finally mean it
It took until now for us both to believe it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it's not like we got back together
We're just coming back to the thing that we know
When you called it off, you said it's for the better
That don't make it easy for me to let go, baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
I'll cut you loose, baby, fly away
I'm holding on to what we had
But I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you back

[Bridge]
Well, call me up if you ever get lonely
Call me up if you ever want me
But until then, I'm setting you free
And if you ever come back to me, baby

I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that

That poor soul, he looks wrecked, puttin' out his last cigarette
As she drives off, hose damn wheels keep turnin' around and 'round in his head
She goes off to someone else
He starts thinkin' to himself

[Chorus]
When she's around, she makes me sad
When she's gone, I wish she'd come back
And she never brings enough to quite ease my pain
That girl's like Texas rain

[Verse 2]
Two shots down, a bottle to go
Nowhere left to drown his soul
Except that hole she left in the driveway
With all her tire tracks
And she goes off to someone else
He starts thinkin' to himself

When she's around, she makes me sad
When she's gone, I wish she'd come back
And she never brings enough to quite ease my pain

Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts

Won’t tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know you got the key to my heart
In my car, let’s go far

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)
And he don't even know a single word

[Verse 1]
I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

[Chorus]
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve

[Bridge]
Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So, I think I'll keep walkin' with my head held high
I keep movin' on and only God knows why
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why
Only God knows why, why, why
Only God knows why

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask for the moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

I used to think that this was my town
What a stupid thing to think
I hear you're fighting off a breakdown
I myself am on the brink
I used to want to be a real man
I don't know what that even means
Now I just want you in my arms again
And we can search each other's dreams

[Chorus]
I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again

[Verse 2]
I've heard enough of the white man's blues
I've sang enough about myself
So if you're looking for some bad news
You can find it somewhere else
Last year was a son of a bitch
For nearly everyone we know
But I ain't fighting with you down in a ditch
I'll meet you up here on the road

[Chorus]
I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again
To a world you want to live in

[Bridge]
We'll ride the ship down
Dumping buckets overboard
There can't be more of them than us
There can't be more

[Chorus]
I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again
To a world you want to live in
To a world you want to live in

Oh, why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now

Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'cause I've seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now

Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'cause even if you're wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you

I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you

I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Baby into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

The sun goes down, another dreamless night
You're right by my side
You wake me up, you say it's time to ride
In the dead of night
Strange canyon road, strange look in your eyes
You shut them as we fly
As we fly

[Verse 2]
Stark, hollow town, Carson City lights
Baby, let's get high
Spend a Johnny's cash, hitch another ride
We laugh until we cry
You say, "Go fast," I say, "Hold on tight"
In the dead of night
Dead of night

See
See the boys as they walk on by

As they walk on by
It's enough to make a young man—

[Verse 3]
Six summers down, another dreamless night
You're not by my side
Scratch on the moon like a familiar smile
Stained on my mind
Some other town, someone else's life
Dead in the night
In the night

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

[Pre-Chorus]
Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

[Verse 2]
If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one

Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can

And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you

To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you could light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah

I want love
To roll me over slowly
Stick a knife inside me
And twist it all around

I want love to
Grab my fingers gently
Slam them in a doorway
Put my face into the ground

I want love to
Murder my own mother
And take her off to somewhere
Like hell or up above

An' I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies
And show me how it's all my fault

I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah, I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore

I want love to
Walk right up and bite me
Grab a hold of me and fight me
Leave me dyin' on the ground

And I want love to
Split my mouth wide open and
Cover up my ears
And never let me hear a sound

I want love to
Forget that you offended me
Or how you have defended me
When everybody tore me down

Yeah, I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies

You promised you will
I'm calling my number
To sort out the thrill

How could I have missed it?
Am I the only one?
Your Lancelot
Twenty-year-old and bored
Run for a better future

Pour lava in the ocean
Drown into the throne that you sit on
Follow, follow, follow me
Holy Father and Son
It's odd enough for you to live on
So long, so long, Salomé

Tell me that's what you wanted (Follow)

I figured you will
Back in September
We'll make it a deal

Twenty years, often bored
Run for a better future

Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess
She goes where the wind suggests she goes, who knows
Got a spirit that can't be tamed
She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

[Chorus]
She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

[Verse 2]
You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

She loves me wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

She'll be here until she runs
Some just have to chase the sun

Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
And he asked me why I did what I did

There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a "Let's get into trouble" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl

Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row

There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a "Play a little Skynyrd" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl

Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (Damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down

But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a "Start a life together" grin
She's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world

I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been getting laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 up your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakings
So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking
I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit giving my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal
So Fuck Off
Yeah

With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash

The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R-O-C-K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do
Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever *be no homo*
I rock from SoHo to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Caray couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off

Yo!
Tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of motherfuckers
Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
FUCK OFF!

Wrapped it 'round an oak tree

In quiet corners where you rarely ever go
One day you find proof she was real
Despite your struggle to forget

Black metal t-shirts your shield
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed

The man she chose to take your place
Turns his collar up to better frame his face
How you'd love to hate her
But you just can't hate somebody you don't know
Oh no

Did she leave a trail of crumbs
So you could find her when you're what you could become
Or did she know you well enough
To realize that garden just won't grow?
Oh no

You're in a fight to the death my friend
Airwaves a grand battlefield
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed

In my sleep I build machines
But nobody ever wants to hear about my dreams
Last night I saw a burning Ferris Wheel
The meaning's anybody's guess
Oh yes

Lovers leave chaos and clothes
More debris that you can sort through in one go
You say love is hell
But it's the ghost of love that's made you such a mess
Oh yes

You're in a fight to the death my friend
Fight like you're chained to the wheel
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed

I'm too old now to learn how to let you in
So I'll run away just like I always do

She said if there's something I should know then tell me now
Before I go and give my heart away
So I can get on with my life
You can go on with your strife
Wish you'd speak the words those eyes are trying to say

[Chorus]
Sometimes this life feels like a big old dream
I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide

[Verse 2]
There's going to be times that I gotta go away
But don't worry baby I'll come home
Out on the road is where I'm going to find my way
But I'll always find the time when I'm alone

So forgive me if sometimes I seem a little crazy
But god damn, sometimes crazy is how I feel
And my brain is starting to swirl
Down the drain of this old world
And there's only one thing girl I know is real

[Bridge]
It's the love that I feel in your arms
It's the glow you wear around you like a charm
It's the tender in your eyes
That keeps me safe and warm at night
From this life

[Chorus]
Sometimes this life feels like a big old dream
I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide

[Verse 1]
Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)

[Verse 2]
"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

[Bridge]
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

[Verse 3]
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

[Chorus]
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still

[Outro]
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So, let this heart be still

[Intro]
American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue

[Verse 1]
She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me

[Verse 1]
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile

Start of song 


Twenty miles left to the show
Hello, my old country, hello
Stars are just beginning to appear
And I have never in my life, before been here

And it's my heart, not me, who cannot drive
At which conclusion you arrived
Watching me sit here bolt upright and cry
For no good reason at the Eastering sky

And the tilt of this strange nation
And the will to remain for the duration
Waving the flag
Feeling it drag

Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
Like I'm in a fist fight with a fog, baby
Step-ball-change and a pirouette
And I regret, I regret

How I said to you, "honey, just open your heart"
When I've got trouble even opening a honey jar
And that right there is where we are...

And I been 'fessing double fast
Addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest at last
And I will love you 'til the noise has long since passed

And I did not mean to shout, just drive
Just get us out, dead or alive
A road too long to mention, lord, it's something to see!
Laid down by the good intentions paving company

All the way to the thing we've been playing at, darlin'
I can see that you're wearing your staying hat, darlin'
For the time being all is well
Won't you love me a spell?

This is blindness beyond all conceiving
Well, behind us the road is leaving, yeah, leaving
And falling back
Like a rope gone slack

Well, I saw straight away that the lay was steep
But I fell for you, honey, as easy as falling asleep
And that right there is the course I keep...

And no amount of talking
Is going to soften the fall
But, like after the rain, step out
Of the overhang, that's all

It had a nice a ring to it
When the ol' opry house rang
So with a solemn auld lang
Signed, sealed, delivered, I sang

And there is hesitation
And it always remains
Concerning you, me
And the rest of the gang

And in our quiet hour
I feel I see everything
And am in love with the hook
Upon which everyone hangs

And I know you meant to show the extent
To which you gave a goddang
You ranged real hot and real cold but I'm sold
I am home on that range

And I do hate to fold
Right here at the top of my game
When I've been trying with my whole heart and soul
To stay right here in the right lane

But it can make you feel over and old
Lord, you know it's a shame
When I only want for you to pull over and hold me
'Til I can't remember my own name


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, layin' next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs

[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine

Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast

Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio

The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone

The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in

But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes

Start of song 


It's not enough that I love you
There's all these things I have to prove to you
You use the sun to erase the past
But you think it only raises for you

Well, I'm afraid of bein' hurt, that's true
But not afraid of any physical pain
Just as I am always scared of water
But not afraid of standin' out in the rain

The last person in the room she hurt
Was the person that the loved the most
Nobody noticed I was down on the rug
I'm gettin' better at becoming a ghost

I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?
And I've hurt you before
But can you ignore my love?
No walkin' out my backdoor
Lookin' back for my love
I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?

People do their best to not let passion begin
It's dead before it has a chance to start
And so there I am, the caretaker of sin
To your abandoned and malignant heart

It's such a pleasure, to sing with you together
Makin' love when there is nobody home
But I can't kiss you 'til you lift up your chin
You have to want to stop being alone

I want you to fight for my love
I want you to fight for my love
I want you to fight for my love


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking about the past
How there is no holding back
No point in wasting sorrow
On things that won't be here tomorrow

But you and I well we don't need to speak
It's the secret that we keep
Out of view and out of sight
Just say when and we'll say goodnight

[Chorus]
Tell me it's okay
To live life this way
Sometimes I want you to stay
I know it's a shame
Shame
Shame

[Verse 2]
Now I have spent so much of my time
Going out of my mind
Trying so hard to be of use
But what you cannot gain you lose

In LA, the sun's almost too bright
I cannot get it right
The emptiness I feel
And now none of it seems real

[Chorus]
So maybe it's alright
If I just spend the night
Sometimes I just can't bear to walk away
I know it's a shame
Shame
Shame

Who have I become
Who will I be
Come tomorrow

Tell me it's okay
If I ask you to stay
Sometimes the night cuts through me like a knife
I know it's a shame
I know it's a shame
I know it's a shame

Shame
Shame
Shame

If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time

She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane


[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

[Verse 2]
I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

[Chorus]
And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt

I'm a newly single man, seein' double
Fake a smile for all my friends
Then go home alone around 2 AM
And stumble through the front door, gone as it gets
Flip the kitchen light on, there it is
On the fridge, just my luck
"Read this if you're drunk"

[Chorus]
Don't think about it, mister
Don't even touch your phone
I know you think you miss her
But I promise you, you don't
There's healing in the lonely
Sit back, kick off your boots
And you'll thank me in the morning
Like you always do
Signed, sober you

[Verse 2]
P.S., there's pizza in the freezer, Dumb and Dumber on the TV
It's so stupid, that's what you'd be
To go diggin' through her Instagram
If you're thinkin' 'bout that, read this again

[Chorus]
Don't think about it, mister
Don't even touch your phone
I know you think you miss her
But I promise you, you don't
There's healing in the lonely
Sit back, kick off your boots
And you'll thank me in the morning
Like you always do
Signed, sober you
Signed, sober you

[Bridge]
Yeah, well remember last time that you hit her up
You heard some other guy, how much does that suck?
That set you back a month, yeah, trust me, old friend
You don't wanna go down that road again

[Chorus]
Don't think about it, mister
Don't even touch your phone
I know you wanna kiss her
But I promise you, you don't
And there's healing in the lonely
Sit back, kick off your boots
And you'll thank me in the morning
Like you always do
Signed, sober you, yeah, yeah
Signed, sober you

I won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
I woke up my baby was gone without her I don't need no home
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line

Went to the bank to get my dough I don't care where I go
Gonna' push this rig 'til I push that girl out of my mind
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

New York City, Old St. Joe, Albuquerque, New Mexico
This old rig is humming and rolling and she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

Six string, quick pickin', what's good motherfucker?
Rebel flag bandana, chromed out Harley Davidson
Damn, motherfucker (Hillbilly hillbilly)
I stay all up in the lime light, higher than a damn kite
Might be sippin' whiskey tryna start me up a bar fight
On MTV with a torch light sparkin' up a blunt
While I'm playin' with some tannerite, bitch
I'm the bare foot rapper
Er'body keepin' distance from
You hear my name, you know I don't play
What the fuck I'm 'bout, and where I came from
I know a lot of rednecks, know a lot of real thugs

Know a lot of motherfuckers in the hollars where I'm from
With a huge pig farm, no fingers no thumbs

Raised in the south, rough hands with slick tongues
Ain't no shit starter but bitch, come and get some
Sippin' on diesel out of a five gallon milk jug
Middle finger kinda guy
Packin' me a big ass 1911
Truck so motherfuckin' loud
God could probably hear that shit way up in heaven
I'm the guy these wannabes rap about
In damn near all their weak verses
Got that fire like a devil, son
But you know I'm accepted in all churches
Death to these weak rappers
Hit the studio in a black hearse
Bitch, I'm sick like Zika virus
I'm the king now sum' bitch close the curtain

[Verse 1]
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

[Chorus]
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

[Outro]
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of
If tomorrow never comes

[Verse 1]
Drivin' through the road work, oh, the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like mem'ries of the miles we shared between
The place you learned to say your prayers, the place I took to prayin'
Loadin' in and breakin' down my road dog door deal dreams
Long before we ever met, I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd have gone about it
You follow me and lead me on and never let me down

[Chorus]
So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine

[Verse 2]
Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn, I wanna taste with you
Goddess in my Days Inn pen, the muse I ain't refusin'
The part of me that ain't around I'm always talking to

[Chorus]
So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it

Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

[Verse 1: Miranda Lambert]
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping

Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping

I'm a little drunk tonight, tryin' to write this song
Tryin' to get it right, but it might turn out all wrong
How do you say the simplest thing, when what you feel ain't simple at all?

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit over my head, but I can' hold back no more
I'm a little bit scared to death, 'cause I ain't been here before
Yeah I'm a little bit unsure what the hell I'm supposed to do
But I'm a whole lot in love with you
I'm a whole lot in love with you

[Verse 2]
The words on this page all look like a mess
They all fall short of what I'm tryin' to confess
My heart is racin' it already knows, what I haven't even told you yet

I'm a little bit over my head, but I can't hold back no more

But I'm ready to raise some hell

I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up

It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'

I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, he's up above
He's watchin' people, everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am

[Chorus 2]
But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

I know with all my certainty
What's going on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you

I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of gettin' by

But I believe in love
I believe in old folks

Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody

If you wanna kiss somebody

Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

Oh, girl loses boy, the best remedy is
Girl meets boy, girl don’t make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hmm hmm
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do

So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain

I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad

Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos

I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies

[Verse 1]
Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said "would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"

[Verse 2]
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

[Verse 3]
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said "when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

[Verse 4]
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead"
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

[Verse 2]
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Verse 3]
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no, it's never felt so right

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Bridge]
No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, oh

I like the way sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin'

You ain't much to look at

You got saggy titties

Cause I learned a lesson
A long time ago
Beggars can't be choosin'
When the bar starts to close

Sit on my face, cause I ain't too picky
And ride my mouth till your pussy gets sticky and all
Aww, aww
Sit on my face, cause I ain't too picky
And ride my mouth till your pussy gets sticky and all
Aww, aww

Come on back to my place
And loosen up your belt
We can order a pizza
While you finger yourself
It don't bother me none
That you smell like piss
I'm gonna lay my head back
And give your twat a kiss

Sit on my face, cause I ain't too picky

Now it's time to clean up

Whatcha doin' Wednesday?

You know where to find me

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
There was a very sacred place back where I grew
Between three old pine trees that nobody knew
I'd close my eyes and pass the time like youngin's often do
But now I'm long gone, completely ruined

Darlin' you and I were made for many different things
To live and learn and lie and laugh, fight and dance and sing
But our hearts have been so battered by the things that we have seen
And I can feel it in the way you look at me

[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done
But circumstances shot us down like September doves
Circumstances shot us down like September doves

[Verse 2]
My grandmother's lullabies used to sing me to sleep
I can't sleep nowadays without liquid relief
Well if lullabies were whiskey then my Grandma's drinks were cheap
I can't afford sleep anymore

And we were never made for love our souls are far too old
But loneliness needs company and a lost dog needs a home
So you will be the fire and I will be the coal
Baby we can burn out of control

[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done
But circumstances shot us down like September doves
Circumstances shot us down like September doves

[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done

These times are trouble
And these times are good
There always gonna be
They rise and they fall
We take them all the way that we should
Together you and me
Forsaking them all

Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

Chorus:
When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind, when I said I do

Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand

Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

Truer than true
You know that I'll always be there for you

[Verse 1]
Back through the years
I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together
Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

[Verse 2]
My coat of many colors
That my mama made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

[Verse 3]
So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me

[Verse 4]
And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story
Mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

[Verse 5]
But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My mama made for me
Made just for me


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

[Verse 2]
Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone

Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

Start of song 


Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been

Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
"If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride"
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land"

Se ha llegado el momento, Chatita del alma, de hablar sin mentiras
Esperé mucho tiempo pa' ver si cambiabas y tú ni me miras
Al principio dijiste que ya que vinieran las nieves de enero
Ir a ver a la virgen y luego casarnos sería lo primero

Ya se fueron las nieves de enero y llegaron las flores de mayo
Ya lo ves, me he aguantado a lo macho y mi amargo dolor me lo callo

Ya se fueron las flores y llegó el invierno y tú ni me miras
Es por eso te digo se llegó el momento de hablar sin mentiras
Al principio dijiste que ya que vinieran las nieves de enero
Ir a ver a la virgen y luego el casarnos sería lo primero
No soporto ya más tus mentiras, esta espera me está destrozando
Al mirar que han pasado los años y no pienso morirme esperando

[Verse 1: Ulysses Everett McGill]
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised

[Delmar & Pete]
The place where he was born and raised

[Verse 2: Ulysses Everett McGill]
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I've found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now

[Delmar & Pete]
He has no friends to help him now

[Verse 3: Ulysses Everett McGill]
It's fair thee well, my old true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train

[Delmar & Pete]
Perhaps he'll die upon this train

[Verse 4: Ulysses Everett McGill]
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
And you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

[Delmar & Pete]
While he is sleeping in his grave

[Verse 5: Ulysses Everett McGill]
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

[Delmar & Pete]
He'll meet you on God's golden shore

I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Oooooaaaooooh
Oooooaaaooooh)

[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Outro]
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

[Verse 1]
Honey, how's that drink goin' down
Seems a little stiff for 2 P.M
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' lines
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

[Verse 2]
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Bean
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

[Bridge]
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
No, you're not the only lonely one

[Verse 1]
One day you wake up
And this life will be over
Every party must break up
For burdens to shoulder
We're dying to live
Living to die
No matter what you believe
And all of us cry
For the ones we must leave

[Chorus]
So go and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

[Verse 2]
Some will beg for forgiveness
From someone above
For something they did
To someone they love
Some scream like a baby
Some go out crying
Some bid the world goodbye
And welcome to die

[Chorus]
Go out and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Livin' my life in the rear view and I'm haunted by
My past and sometimes I just wanna die (Die)
I need to change my ways (Ways), mama, I'm gonna try (Try)
But that's a lie 'cause you heard me say that a thousand times
I said Lord please help me
'Cause I've been living unhealthy
And the life that I've been livin' Lord (Livin' Lord)
Can I really be forgiven for?

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (Control)

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
And they ask me how I'm feelin'
I'm somewhere between Hendrix and Robin Williams
Hide behind the tears of a clown (Clown)
And the sound (Sound), of silence (Silence), it seems so loud (So loud)
Would you just look at me now
When I take a shot of Crown and wash this Percocet down
Played the victim for too long to justify my habits
Knowing everything I touch turns tragic (Tragic)

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause the glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self (Struggle) control (Control)

[Verse 3: Struggle Jennings]
I guess I'm narcissistic 'cause I'm tryin' to get it
Am I bein' selfish attemptin' to rid my life from the drama in it?
See it was harder comin' home than goin' in
Hard to understand that statement unless you came from where I've been
Why its difficult to do right but so easy to sin
Findin' peace in losin' to move on from the chaos of the win
That demon in the mirror is still the saint that he portrays
So the songs of tomorrow borrow sorrows from today

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (Control)

[Outro: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold

[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of losing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart she'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think:
This hurt inside of me ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
Watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket

[Verse 1]
Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seeini that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling "Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!"
We yelled five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

[Verse 3]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, "Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket"
Can't you give me five more minutes?

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

[Verse 3]
At eighty-six, my grandpa said
There's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round
We knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed
Lord, I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah, sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
Five more minutes

I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)

I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

[Verse 2]
If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

[Chorus]
We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light

[Outro]
Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light

It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you

[Verse 2]
It's all over but the crying
And nobody's crying but me
Friends all over know I'm trying
To forget about how much I care for you
It's all over but the dreaming
Poor little dreams that keep trying to come true
It's all over but the crying
And I can't get over crying over you


Start of song 


Led through the mist
By the milk-light of moon
All that was lost is revealed

Our long bygone burdens
Mere echoes of the spring
But where have we come?

And where shall we end?
If dreams can't come true
Then why not pretend?

How the gentle wind
Beckons through the leaves
As Autumn colors fall

Dancing in a swirl
Of golden memories
The loveliest lies

Of all

[Verse 1]
Basic was just like papaw says:
"Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine"
Just another enlisted egg
In the bowl for Uncle Sam's beater
When you get to Dam Neck
Hear a voice in your head
Saying, "my life's no longer mine"
Have you running with some SAD SOG
BMF sandeaters

[Verse 2]
Setting out on them high seas
Feels just like being born
That first port call in Thailand
Feels like a pollywog turning nineteen
They've got king cobras fighting in boxing rings
And all the angels play Connect Four
Seems like a sailor's paradise
But turns out to be a bad dream

[Verse 3]
Now you hit the ground running in Tokyo
From Kawasaki to Ebisu
Yokosuka, Yokohama, and Shinjuku
Shibuya, Ropongi, and Harajuku
Aw, from Pusan and Pohang, Pattaya to Phuket
From Singapore to Kuala Lumpur
Seen damn near the whole damn world
From the inside of a bar

[Chorus]
I've got sea stories
They're all true
Might seem a little bit far-fetched
But why would I lie to you
Memories of ink forever stained
Still got salt running through my veins
I've got sea stories
And my shellback, too

[Verse 4]
Sometimes Sirens send a ship off course
Horizon gets so hazy
Maybe get high, play a little GoldenEye
On that old 64
And if you get sick and can't manage the kick
And get yourself kicked out the navy
You'll spend the next year trying to score
From a futon life raft on the floor
And the next fifteen trying to figure out
What the hell you did that for

But flying high beats dying for lies
In a politician's war

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore

You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher

Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Ever since you caught that out there bug

Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now

Got no gas in his neon light

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go

You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go

Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

[Verse 2]

You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah, it’s hurting, but it ain’t dead

Just something that I can believe in

In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets

'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'

We fired once more and they begin to runnin'

Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'

En un tabaco o en un Swisher, saca la pipa, será mucho mejor

I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

A flat cap on the dash
Windows rolled down in the wind
While birds fly past
Singing along with the radio
A little outta tune
Hanging onto that steering wheel
Was the man who hung the moon

Used to wrap my hands around his little finger
Turns out he was wrapped around mine
He said "You can be anything you want to in this great big world"
But I'm always gonna be daddy's little girl

He always used to tell me "Don't grow up too fast
Love will come, love will go, your first won't be your last"
I didn't always listen when he gave me advice
Though I hate to admit it, but that man was always right

Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun, mmm
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Bridge]
Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes
Sometimes

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend

Following somebody else's path and doing the same shit they're doing, the same style they're doing it, that ain't fuckin' legendary
BandPlay, BandPlay, BandPlay, BandPlay
Ripping off and making your own path and your own style and doing shit your way, that's fuckin' legendary son
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow

[Verse 1]
La-lately I've been hearin' rumors, oh Upchurch got his ass kicked
Well that's funny, 'cause I didn't feel it and I ain't seen no video yet
Sounds like somebody needs publicity
I don't let these bitch boys get to me
Do you know who I am? I'm Mr. Tennessee
Who the fuck are you? I forgot instantly
I got a four speed Ford, couple bucks to my name
I don't care about money, put some 'spect on my name
I put fire in the game while I spits blue flame
I don't care about these boys if they ridin' in my lane
Yeah I'm here with a machete and ready to slit throats
Smokin' dope while I'm droppin' you out of my bass boat
Concrete around your feet, motherfucker now float
Go swim with the fish like you work at Bass Pro
(Work at Bass Pro, work at Bass Pro, work at Bass Pro)

[Verse 2]
Fuck tellin' folks about your big truck
Fuck claimin' all you do is fish and hunt
Fuck chuggin' beer in your music video
'Cause you think that gets you credit son
Ever since the Robertson's got a TV show
Everybody hell yeah and with their camo on
And you ain't real apparently if you don't jam to them old songs
Half y'all punks never heard of John Denver
Old country road on a different level
Everybody got a this, everybody got a that
Blah blah blah blah 'bout your John Deere hat
I don't care about no fashion statement
These bare feet used to run the pavement
I'd been known about fuckin' years ago
But I didn't care to go video tape it
Got a lot of honkies runnin' on my team (Team)
Shit look like a Donald Trump regime (Gime)
Bitch, I'll run you over, where's the key?
I am here to stay I will not leave
I am in a place you cannot see
Deep in Dixieland between the trees
Steady laughin' at you wannabees (Bees)
And if you really wanna fuck with me

I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow

[Verse 1]
I, I been gone
Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

[Chorus]
I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Verse 2]
You, look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rocking, foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Sure is hard to remember
Life before you walked in the picture
I was a sad Mona Lisa with a crooked frame
Standing on my platform, waiting for my train

[Verse 2]
I was messed up, wondering, broke down, stumbling
Running for my life
Was heartbroke, hard up, a long string of bad luck
Searching with no end in sight

[Chorus]
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby

[Verse 3]
It's like the walls soaked down and the lights turned on
And the band started playing a different song
Like I was baptized by the fire in your kiss
No I've never, ever, ever felt like this

[Chorus]
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby
Before you called me baby

[Bridge]
I was drowning, wasted, lost and jaded
Hanging by a thread
I was sinking, shook up, and almost gave up
On this lonely heart in my chest

[Chorus]
Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby, before you called me baby
Before you called me baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the front step, little white suitcase
Hearing that diesel, 'fore it hit the front gate
His headlights burning down a Friday night
Southern belle statue standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world head for an old Ford
With a man that can't look her in the eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to him, big hug, jump in
And I cry for her out the window

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle

[Verse 2]
Bowling alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee
Baby, how's your school been and how's your mom?
Patsy Cline echoes back off the dashboard
Starin' at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby two weeks ain't really all that long

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I'll run to her
Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry for him out the window

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are lovin' in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck in a love triangle
In a love triangle, yeah

[Chorus]
Some mamas and daddies are loving in a straight line
Take forever to hearten and take a long sweet ride
But some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle Oh-oh
And some mamas and daddies ran out of love in '94
And some mamas and daddies don't even talk no more
And some mamas and daddies let their heartstrings tear and tangle
And some of us get stuck and some of us grow up
In a love triangle


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all the thought you're giving me is, conscience I guess
If I were walking in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying 'bout me
I'm having lots of fun

[Chorus]
Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

[Verse 2]
Last night I dressed in tails pretending I was on the town
As long as I can dream, it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

[Chorus]
Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

[Verse 3]
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

[Chorus]
Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there

[Bridge]
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind

[Chorus]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be

You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Oh, heaven help me
I been sowwin' wildflower seeds
And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe
So guess what?

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh

Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses and my Tony Lamas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?
What?!

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 1]
River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

[Chorus]
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

[Verse 2]
Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather

[Verse 1]
What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?

To live in memory

And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together

Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever

I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment, life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong

I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

There is nothing I wouldn't give

And you're the answer to my prayers from up above

You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ole' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' through the pines

And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun

So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones

Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
Til' they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay

So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played

So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones

You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of

[Chorus]
A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me, yeah

Yeah, I'm her sure thing
I'm her go to
I'm her rock solid
She ain't gon' ever lose a-

Small town boy like me
I'm her ride or die baby
I'm her cool, I'm her crazy
I'm her laid back in the front seat

Let's turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl

She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me
Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me

Waiter send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where're you gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?

You should always let the sun go down on your anger
Let it burn you to sleep
Bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
But I am tired
And I am yours

Don't even think about your freedom or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your "I" statements and your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now

Oh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you, it ain't never gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home

I am tired
I am tired
I don't wanna go home anymore
I don't wanna throw stones anymore
I don't wanna take part in the war

I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still

I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore
I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
Oh, I am tired
But I'm coming home

'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours

Mum and Dad and Danny saw the passing
Out parade at Puckapunyal
It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was the next to tour and it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left

And Townsville lined the footpaths
As we marched down to the quay
This clipping from the paper
Shows us young and strong and clean
And there's me in me slouch hat with me SLR and greens
God help me - I was only nineteen

From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
And we made our tents a home
V.B. and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian Orange sunset through the scrub

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M16?
And what's this rash that comes and goes
Can you tell me what it means?
God help me - I was only nineteen

A four week operation
When each step can mean your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down
'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about somethin' else

And then someone yelled out "Contact"
And the bloke behind me swore
We hooked in there for hours
Then a God almighty roar
And Frankie kicked a mine
The day that mankind kicked the moon
God help me - he was goin' home in June

And I can still see Frankie
Drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row

And the ANZAC legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me - I was only nineteen

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?
And what's this rash that comes and goes
Can you tell me what it means?
God help me, I was only nineteen

[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Letra de "En Donde Está Tu Amor"

El tiempo que pasó
Se lo llevó la vida
Solo queda tu aroma
Con la cama destendida

Recuerdos se apoderan de mi mente
Un vaso con un tequila caliente
El dolor haciéndonos compañía
Y yo que pensaba que no dolía

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?
¿A dónde se marchó?
A dónde se esfumó aquella esperanza de que vuelvas
Y es que solo el sabor de tus besos me llega

Y lo que sucedió
Que a la gente le asombre
Y es que lo que me hiciste en verdad que no tiene nombre
De que sirve tu adiós si ya no volverás

Aquí te esperaré
Si piensas regresar

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?

Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
And pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision

[Verse 2]
With fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another

[Verse 3]
Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

[Verse 4]
Well Jesus was an only son
And love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one, and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Keep your injured looks to you
And we'll tell the world that we tried

Ooo eeee, I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody pass me by

Hey, Miley
It's me, I’m in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, can’t
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone too
But anyhow, see what you think
And mmm, here I go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Come on
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned and I smile
’Cause I know if we tried, we could really make a difference in this world
I won’t give up or sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can start livin’ in a rainbowland

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I’d be lyin'), if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here (hate going on here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Oh, wouldn't it be nice (so nice) to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right (all things right), and end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win
(C'mon)

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin'), if I said this was fine

We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together (let's do it together)
Change things forever (forever)
I know there's got to be a greater plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (shine my head)
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
Wish I could do a little better
At least, I might not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well...

[Verse 1]
I've been around for 20 some odd years
I learned a thing or two about love
Relationship after relationship
Both sides givin' up
I'm not a man that's gonna settle for less
And I don't wanna be divorced
I want a love different than all the rest
I want a girl worth fightin' for
But I guess one day we'll see

[Chorus]
But if it ain't that head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Yeah, I don't want it, if it ain't that kind of love

[Verse 2]
Longin' on are my young buck days
Some childish things, I'm puttin' those away
I've seen a love in my mind that I'm tryin' to find
So I'm not wasting time on
Anything less than a love that's real

[Chorus]
Well if it ain't that head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Yeah, I don't want it, if it ain't that kind of love

Day and night I watch and pray
And I don't care how long it takes
Lord only you I'd rather wait to find my love

If it ain't that head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'

[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

[Chorus - Variation]
And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out"
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now

I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party

They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party

He said "I'll love you til I die"
She told him "you'll forget in time"
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

[Verse 2]
He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

[Chorus]
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

[Bridge]
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time - he's over her for good

Wish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other

You drink my whiskey without askin'
You put your boots up on my couch
It drives me crazy to remind you
More than once to take the garbage out
You use my good towels on the dog
That's the only thing I've asked you not to do
Most days I'd love to lock you out
I can't live without you

[Verse 2]
The kitchen table ain't for business
I wish you'd put the bills where they go
I guess you'd need an invitation
To the backyard to see that it needs mowed
You leave your whiskers in the sink
And I've told you 'til I'm black and blue
You've never worried what our neighbors think
I can't live without you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got my back even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along
I got reasons to cry and can't tell you which one
But you don't ask no questions, you just hold me 'til I'm done
And when I'm lookin' to fight, you flat refuse
I can't live without you

[Verse 3]
You're always voicin' your opinion
You play your guitar way too loud
And God I reckon it would kill you
To lift a finger and help me clean this house
You know, your jokes ain't all that funny
But I'll keep on laughin' if you want me to
Nobody understands why I love you
I can't live without you

[Chorus]
You've got my back even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along
I got some reasons to cry but can't tell you which one

I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
But on the darkest day there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you

[Verse 2]
I hear it fallin' in the night, and fillin' up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light, I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin' through the trees, and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe, I never liked the rain

(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain)
Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

[Verse 2]
When the cloud is rollin' over, thunder's strikin' me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, fallin'

(Like the rain)
I have fallen for you and I know just why, you

Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now

And when the night falls on our better days, and we're lookin' to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways, to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin', forever we'll be fallin'

Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain

[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh

[Chorus]
Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep

[Verse 2]
Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special

I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Take a look at what the industry did to me
I was drinkin' Hennessy and then I had an epiphany
Got me thinkin' I should kill 'em, and I'm sayin' it literally
Middle fingers to my enemies, I don't give 'em this energy
Got a horse in the back and a goat in the front
And I'm pourin' out yak while I'm smokin' a blunt
And a trap and cowboy hat and a pump
'Cause I ain't going out like a rat or a punk
Don't be silly man I really gotta kill him
When I'm loadin' up the semi hit him in the cerebellum
I was raised on the farm and the city full of felons
Keeps a knife on deck like I'm trimmin' down a hedges

[Verse 2]
Ciggy hangin' out my mouth, I got Carharrt on my jacket
I was raised down in the south eatin' moose meat and catfish
Everything I eat I caught, flannel undies like a boss
I just watered all my crops, load my truck I'm takin' off
We're ridin' down that dirt road on that Sunday night
With the windows rolled down on the country side
Saw a reflection in the mirror and I thought oh my-my
I said, "Ooh pretty girl you make me feel alright!"
Catch me drinkin' out of the keg with my chickens hatchin' eggs
You would think I'd act my age but I'm pissed like everyday
You can call me white trash but I don't give a fuck
Someone pass the Zig Zag's and let's get lifted like my truck

[Verse 3]
'Bout to turn my backyard into a shootin' range
Who's to blame? Headshot, I got stupid aim
I won't stop 'til a motherfuckin' rooster sing
I sold my Ford to put a Hemi in my new Mustang (Yah!)
I'm the real Garth Brooks of this rap shit
So Billy Ray Cyrus if he want it he can have it
I've got Hannah Montana at my ranch gettin' hammered
I'm a savage catch me hackin' up wood doin' damage
I'm just sayin' I ain't goin' out like that
Got a feather behind my ear beneath my cowboy hat
Got a years worth of deer, you can count on that
Like a steakhouse, I'm out back

[Chorus]
Let's have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
Yeah!

We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

[Verse 2]
We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyears and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one

[Verse 1]
You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Verse 2]
Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down

Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)

I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  (against me)

[Verse 1]
There’s a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn’t find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue
This one’s for you

[Verse 2]
Mom and daddy always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn’t help himself
I thank God they were there to see me through
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
But his one’s for you

[Verse 3]
I’ve been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and few good friends
Who reminded me of all I stood to lose
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
Yeah I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
This one’s for you

(Oh, yee-eeah)
Uuu-uuu-uuu-uu-uu

Made more than my fair share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned
A few things that I can’t change
Some apologies are way past overdue
So this one’s for you

[Chorus]
Wow, I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time (Time, time)
And these might not be the right lines to prove (To prove)
For saying what I’m trying to
This one’s for you

[Verse 1: Maddie, both]
Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it

[Chorus: both]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

[Verse 2: both]
Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

[Chorus: both]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On The Way Down

[Bridge: both]
You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly

[Chorus: both]
Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't be denied
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank

Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak

I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

Good for the needy, like Nietzsche, Freud and Horace
But I'm skinflint, broke, makin' no money, makin' jokes
But baby, I won't joke with you

My feet are burnin' like a Roman hypocaust
But the Romans are gone, they changed their name because they lost
She writes letters like a Jack Chick comic
Just a buncha' propaganda, make my fingers histrionic;
Like this, and this

I mean, she's my baby
But she makes me get avuncular
And when my monkey is jumpin'
I got no time to make it up to her

I fantasize about the hospital
The army, asylum, confinement in prison
Any place where there's a cot to clear my vision

I spit it out
Whatever's in my mouth
Just like that Black Bat Licorice
Yeah, that Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
Yeah

I wanna cut out my tongue and let ya' hold onto it for me
'Cause without my skill to amplify my sounds it might get boring
I've got the wit of the staircase with atomic clock precision
And the phases of the moon directin' all of my decisions like this

When I need to know, I play dumb like Columbo
And get my feelin's hurt and move to NY like I'm Dumbo
Don't you want to lose the part of the brain that has opinions?
To not even know what you are doing, or care about yourself or your species in the billions

Yeah, I have to spit it out
Ah, whatever's in my mouth
Ah, I have to spit it out (behave yourself)
Just like that Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice, I never liked it, I never will
Now state the same damn thing with the violin

Whatever you feed me
I feed you right back
But it will do no good

Well we're all wasted in a bar somewhere downtown
When I man walks up and pokes me with a knife and says
"Man, I'm gonna send you to hell."
Well I took that knife, I stared him straight in the eyes
I said, "Oh, boy you better fuckin' run
I've been sittin' here just a-slammin' down beers
And now its time to have some fun"
Oh

[Verse 2]
Oh well he hit me hard, yeah he hit me good
And then I fell to the ground
But I kicked him fast, I kicked him real swift
And he came a tumblin' down
He took a stab at me and nearly cut my gut
But I kicked that knife to the floor
Then I took his head and slammed it into the bar
I don't think he'll come around no more
Oh

[Chorus]
Well I've been drinkin' here for so many damn years
Tryin' to recap my life
Every night trouble finds my sight and I can't help but fight
With a bottle of Jack and a tin of skoal
I'll be stickin' around
Until the day a man will put me away and...
I can rest my soul

[Verse 3]
Well we're all wasted in a bar
Somewhere downtown
When a man walks up and pokes me with a knife and says
"Man, I'm gonna send you to hell."
Well I took that knife, I stared him straight in the eyes
I said "Oh boy this is the day."
Then I took that knife and stabbed it straight through my eye
And then I fell to my knees
Oh

Well I've been drinkin' here for so many damn years
Tryin' to recap my life
Every night trouble finds my sight and I can't help but fight
With a bottle of Jack and a tin of skoal
I'll be stickin' around
Until the day a man will put me away and...
I can rest my soul

[Verse 1]
Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth

Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses

Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up

[Verse 1]
It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey, and water, into wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
But it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
(Hmm)

[Verse 2]
When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
When your back's against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
Yeah, that rebel fight inside of you
Has been there all along

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
(Oh, ohh)

[Chorus 2]
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Huh, everybody's got a little frontman swagger
Stone cold rollin' like a young Mick Jagger
A new tattoo that you can't keep hidden
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, yeah
(Oh, ohh)

All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 3]
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

[Chorus]
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, ooh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah

[Verse 3]
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (Don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I'm strong, I'm sure, I'm in control, a lady with a plan
Believing that life is a neat little package I hold in my hand
I've got it together, they call me the girl who knows just what to say and do
Still, I fumble and fall, run into the wall, 'cause when it comes to you

[Chorus]
I'm just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman, just another woman in love

[Verse 2]
So pardon me if I should stare and tremble like a child
That wanting me look all over your face is driving me wild
I'm just what you make me, can't wait till you take me and set all my feelings free
I know that you can, so come be my man, tonight I want to be

[Chorus]
I'm just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman, just another woman in love
Just another woman in love, a kid out of school
A fire out of control, just another fool
You touch me and I'm weak, I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman

Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis singing Gospel
It's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl, you're put together perfectly

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

[Verse 2]
Like cat daddy driving a caddy from Cali, baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an Old Camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)
That do me like you (Do me like you)
The way you move that body (The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth

[Bridge]
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam (Jam, jam)

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)

Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth (You so smooth)

Start of song 


If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon

Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
"Can't you just get over it?"
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it

[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down

Turn the radio up so the girl can sing, right
Pull into the party like "y'all wassup?"

[Verse 1]
Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

The city’s so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, I love these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know and I feel like there’s no one here but me

[Chorus]
Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say "hi"
Then Friday night it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you’re still in my head
There ain’t no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown’s dead, downtown’s dead

[Verse 2]
They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throws of loud house music
Everything’s a blur
I don’t hear the words, but lips are moving
Try to get involved, but I’ve 'bout had enough of people wall to the wall
And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause...

Downtown’s dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say "hi"

Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit… I’ve had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can’t get you out of my head
I’m calling it a night
I’m crawling back to your bed…

[Verse 1]
That old phone of mine, 2:39
A.M. when I got the call
Half asleep
Thought it was a dream
But it wasn’t after all
That old dog of yours
Sitting on the porch
Waits for you to come home
Little does he know
That you won’t
Be walking through that door

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave him alone
Cause letting go don’t come that easily
Most of the time, I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Verse 2]
That old rocking chair
Sitting over there
It don’t rock no more
And that old six string
Ain't played a thing
Been awhile since it’s hummed a chord

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave 'em alone cause letting go
Don’t come that easily
Most of the time
I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Bridge]
There’s a lot of things in this 'ole world I can stand
But when it comes to losing you
I just can’t

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I'll never get used to
No, I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Outro]
Yeah, being gone
I’m never getting used to you being gone

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 1]
Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying "Keep it down"
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind

[Bridge]
I said, "Hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over?"
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot

[Chorus]
My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head

I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
You look good in my t-shirt, baby
Yeah
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
You look good in my t-shirt
Yeah, I think you look good in my t-shirt, uh
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
Oh, you look so good in my t-shirt

Tina Nolan had a man with a good place for siftin’
He invited me diggin’, so I picked up my screen
And a shovel to dig and a jar of shine
He traded me fair for a bottle of wine
His brother’s Barnes Mountain wine

We trudged through the snow straight up the hillside
Took a ridge for a while, then we slowly went down
To an overhang  hid from the ridgeline
We bent o'er our handles and we bit in the ground
The dark and bloody ground

Was a bitch to break ground but the wine kept us goin'
The moonshine was flowin' and keepin' us warm
'Cause you can’t hold a girl with a fistful of shovel
Got to find your fire in the company of corn

We dug for a while then it all turned to ashes
Found a bunch of broke flint and a few bits of bone
Then I heard Jesse yell o'er the pile he was sifting
Shook the hills like the angels were callin’ us home
Jesse, Zachary come home

It was banded as hell, it was fluted and clovis
It was hot as the pistol I kept on my side
I was fiending so fierce, I was broke ass and busted
I pulled out my pistol and I took Jesse’s life

A clovis like that is a hard point to find
Makes pills swift to come by with a good chunk of change
Left over for burn on whatever meanness
Whatever woman is comin' my way
Darlin' come my way

I sit in this cell for the banded clovis
I stole off of Nolan when I killed'm that day
I reckon the chase of the pills and the powder
Corn liquor and women are the culprits to blame

[Verse 1]
Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes

[Chorus]
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

[Verse 2]
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

[Chorus]
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness I suppose

[Verse 3]
The poets tell how old Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

[Chorus]
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

[Outro]
A few gray Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness I suppose

[Verse 1]
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Verse 2]
You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh
Ooh!

[Verse 1]
No need to give a bunch of lame half-assed excuses
Why this ain’t love, I’m blonde but I ain’t stupid
I wasn’t looking for a ring it doesn’t mean it doesn’t sting
When you cut and run so soon
Good luck, so long
I guess I better get to leavin' too

[Chorus]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin' your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half-smoked cigarette’s still smoked
And a half broke heart’s still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke

[Verse 2]
Upfront no strings
Sure fun till it unravels
Won't see me cry
But I might kind of want to call you tonight
Pour me a drink but don't make it too strong
Cause I need a little kicker to help me move on
I could say I don't care
But just okay ain't all the way there

[Chorus]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin' your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half-smoked cigarette’s still smoked
And a half broke heart’s still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke

[Bridge]
Just because you don't call it love don't mean it don't mean a thing
I saw it coming and no hard feelings but it's hard feeling this way

[Chorus 2]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong sized shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin your feet at midnight
A half-cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na

Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks, but I’m spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Party all day like you at your alma mater (At your alma mater)
Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)

And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like it’s Jamaica and I’m sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I’m in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation (I got, I got, I got)

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let’s don’t talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen

[Chorus]
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat

Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet

Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans

There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it

Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart

Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow

Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, it's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

Now we're standing in the ring
And you made your first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she's standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

Looks like we're going to war

Woke up today and decided to kill my ego
It ain't ever done me no good no how
Gonna break through and blast off to the Bardo
In them flowers of light far away from the here and now

Taking a 49 divine day vacation
From reality and all else in between
Gonna transmigrate to my destination
Far beyond time in an eternal dream

But am I dreaming or am I dying
Either way I don't mind at all
Oh it feels so good you just can't help but crying
Oh you have to let go so the soul may fall

Oh my God it's so beautiful
Everything is a part of me
It's so hard looking through all the lies made of wool
But if you close your eyes it becomes so easy to see

They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury"
Sweet luxury

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

[Verse]
You were that whiskey running through my veins
You were that first sweet taste of Mary Jane
All alone in the darkness watching my hands shake
But they don’t have a rehab for heartbreak

It’s your blue sundress with the strap falling off of your shoulder
It’s that all night moonlight drive, you saying baby pull over, pull over
It’s that long kiss barely coming up for air
Had to have you anytime and everywhere
So hooked on you probably never get clean and sober

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em

It’s the rain on the window with your body wrapped tight around me
It's that lightning flash in your eyes make me want you so badly, madly
You’re the ghost that’s still sleeping in my bed
A song I can’t turn off in my head
You’re the perfect storm, yeah baby, and I’m still drowning

Whoa, I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em

I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals, yeah

I bang my head against the moon
I bang my fist against the wall
You always used to get me high
Now all I do is crash and fall
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
I’m going through withdrawals
Yeah you got me going through ‘em

Hey momma, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Momma can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress

[Chorus: both]
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?

[Verse 2: Maddie, both]
Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Momma, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

[Chorus: both]
How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

[Bridge: Maddie, Tae, both]
Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard?
(Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark?
(In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?
Momma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?

To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Momma, can you die from a broken heart?

You kept all the things I threw away
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year, well
We're just a box of souvenirs, 'cause

[Chorus]
Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame

[Verse 2]
This meant more to you than it did to me
I was full of doubts and you believed
The more that you keep coming over
The more I know it's over, dear, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs, and

Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored

I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too long
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?

Dusty trail, saw vapor light
Was it a mirage? I don't know, but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world

I drive home the same way, two left turns off the interstate
And she's always standing at the stoplight on 18th Street
She could be a Sarah, she could be an Emily
An Olivia, maybe Cassidy
With the shaky hands on the cardboard sign
And she's lookin' at me

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
And I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter

[Verse 2]
Did she give up wondering where the cars all go?
And can she even tell that I don't know what to say?
So I just nod my head and wave
Well, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be
Or why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography
And whether it shines or rains

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Countin' change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder how she fell and no one caught her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter

[Bridge]
Oh, I don't know the reasons why
I'm the one who's driving by
And she's the one on the corner of 18th Street

[Chorus]
Bet she was somebody's best friend
Back when she was somebody's sister (Somebody's daughter)
Bet she was somebody's first kiss, oh
Dancing in a gym where the kids all talk about someday, someday
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
Oh, and I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
She's somebody's daughter

It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?

And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye

What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over

I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness

[Chorus]
But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

[Verse 2]
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool

‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beer…
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting’ on a hundred mill…
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel…

[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, huhn huh
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, huhn hah
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream

You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other

And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Ending]
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer...

Well Reverend, Reverend, please come quick
'Cause I got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks
Of Good Ole Miss
He drove a Series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip

[Chorus]
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

[Verse 2]
And he said "I know you, I know you young man
"I know you by the state of your hands
"You're a six-string picker, just as I am
"Let me learn you somethin': I know a few turns to make all the girls dance

[Chorus]
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

[Verse 3]
Oh foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons had a price, oh sweet price
My sweet soul everlasting, a very own eternal light

[Chorus]
Don't you know that the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
Well, the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

[Verse 1]
Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately
Mama's never here and step daddy hates me
He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean
Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams
Today I dropped my bowl of s'ghetti on the floor
I didn't mean to make a mess, I tripped on one of my toys
I tried to clean it up, really I tried
But I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide
I knew if Benny saw it I'd be in so much trouble
I didn't want to, but I did
And the thought of gettin' hit scared me so I didn't tell him
Benny saw it, he took off his belt and
You know... he hit me with it
Then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the s'ghetti spilted
But I forgive him though
I love you daddy, I guess I gotta go

[Hook]
There's a moth on my window seal
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain
I gaze into the storm
And I imagine I'm the son of a man
Who will hold me close and near
With these bruises on my face I cry
While I pray to disappear

[Verse 2]
Daddy are you there?
I know you're probably busy off working somewhere
Helpin' somebody, build a house or somethin' neat
You told me what you did, carpentry, right?
Man, that's so cool, daddy
I really miss you, so much that I would kiss you
Yeah even front of my friends
I guess you know I'm gettin' sick again
I've been throwin' up, I haven't been playin' much
I missed a lot of school this week, but I'm tough
I'll make it, you know me, daddy
I don't get what I want most of the time but I'm patient
Hey if you get a second
Maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in
Because my babysitter's crazy
Mama don't believe me but she makes me get naked
And I'm embarrassed so I hide it
I'm tellin' you because you know my heart and what's inside it
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?

When the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze
I float away
To the end of the world, to the moon, to the stars
To the heavens where I'm safe
I’m a child, not a prey. I’m an angel, enslaved
I'm a life, I'm a world, I'm a rose, put to waste
Wake me up, let me live, let me breathe, let me breathe
Give me love, give me soul, give me guidance, give me peace
Disappear

Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September

Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?

Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine

From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find

Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me

You were only fading
I was on my own
Starin' at the ceiling

Hold, holdin' out

Read it on a map
Never how I planned it
Holdin' on for work
Taking it for granted

I was looking up
I was being blinded
Holdin' on for work
Hopin' that I'd find it

I was looking up
Holding on to patience
Counting up the days
Days that I'd been waiting

You can take your time
I'll be on the front porch
Keepin' on the light
You can see it if you look for it

I would lie awake at night
Hopin' that one day I'd run
I had waited all my life

I was holdin'
Holding you

Waited for you

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane

But what a thrill

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
But you came along and you moved me honey
I've changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

Kiss me baby
Ooh, it feels good
Hold me baby, yeah
You gotta let me love you like a lover should
You’re fine, so kind
I’m gon‘ tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails, I twiddle my thumbs
I'm gettin‘ nervous honey, but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

[Verse 1]
Just the other night, at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

[Verse 2]
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

[Chorus]
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

[Verse 3]
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin', after all

[Bridge]
And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord, for the gifts in my life

[Chorus]
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts, are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts, are unanswered prayers

Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh Sweet darling
You get the best of my love

I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours

Oh, but who needs sleep?

Time and time again Lord I keep going through the motions
A means to an end but the ends don't seem to meet
Walking around living the dream anytime I take the notion
Til the truth comes bubbling up so bittersweet

Ain't no point getting outta bed if you ain't living the dream
It's like making a big old pot of coffee when you ain't got no cream
I don't need to change my strings
Cause the dirt don't hurt the way I sing
I don't have to do a Goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die

Been waiting on an angel waitress to come and take my order
Tell me all about the special today
Staring at a puddle of mud in my spoon couldn't be much boarder
Hoping them circles on the paper don't call back telling me to start today

That old man upstairs, he wears a crooked smile
Staring down at the chaos he created
Said son if you ain't having fun just wait a little while
Momma's gonna wash it all away
And she thinks Mercy's overrated

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said "speak now"

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

[Chorus - Variation]
And you say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"

I was in the shower so I could not tell my nose was bleeding
Dripped down my body to the floor right below my feet and
I looked in the mirror at my face, I thought I had a disease

And there's a woman with her fingers in my icebox
She peeked around the corner, asked me if I'm okay
She put the ice upon my tongue and then it melted away

Alright, oak floor, soft pine bedroom door, yeah
Speak easy, make her mine if she's bored, yeah
And there's a dry pine ceilin' that is outta my reach

I woke up and my hands were gone, yeah
I looked down and my legs were long gone
I felt for her with my shoulder, but there's nobody there

I thought she left a note, just the tag on the pillow there
And then I noticed there's a rag next to my ear
The clock was ringin', but it wasn't nothin' that I could hear

Alright
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Sometimes someone controls everything about you
And when they tell you that they just can't live without you
They ain't lyin', they'll take pieces of you
And they'll stand above you and walk away
That's right, and take a part of you with them

Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math

I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson  with Dan + Shay]
If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow

'Cause I know I'm only human

And this is for the questions that don't have an answer
The midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
The can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers

The northern lights and the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
And all my heroes at the methadone clinics

All you bastards at the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress

All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie (Come on)

[Verse 2]
For the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang
Wild mustangs, the porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six

The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

[Chorus]
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And therefor I reside in Tennessee

Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
The old man was covered with tattoos and scars
He got some in prison and others in bars
The rest he got working' on old junk cars
In the daytime
They looked like tombstones in our yard
And I never seen him when he wasn't tired and mean
He sold used parts to make ends meet
Covered with grease from his head to his feet
Cussing the sweat and the Texas heat
And the skeeters
And the neighbors said we lived like hicks
But they brung their cars for paw to fix anyhow
He was veteran-proud, tried and true
He'd fight till his heart was black and blue
Didn't know how he'd made it through the hard times
He bought our house on the G.I. bill
But it wasn't worth all he had to kill to get it
He drank pearl in a can and Jack Daniels black
Chewed tobacco from a mail pouch sack
Had an old dog that was trained to attack
Sometimes
He'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake
And there wasn't too much
That he would take from a stranger

[Bridge 1]
There were thirteen kids and a bunch of dogs
A house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs
I spent the summertime cutting' up logs for the winter
Trying' like the devil to find the lord
Working' like a nigga for my room and board
Coal-burning stove, no natural gas
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

[Chorus]
If that ain't country
It'll harelip the pope
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry
And I've met Johnny Cash
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

[Verse 2]
Mama sells eggs at a grocery store
My oldest sister is a first-rate whore
Dad says she can't come home anymore
And he means it
Ma just sits and keeps her silence
Sister, she left because dad got violent
And he knows it
Mama she's old far beyond her time
From chopping tobacco and I've seen her crying
When blood started flowing from her calloused hand and
It hurt me
She'd just keep working' trying' to help the old man
To the end of one row and back again like always
She's been through hell since junior went to jail
When the lights go out she ain't never failed
To get down on her knees and pray
Because she loves him
Told all the neighbors he was off in the war
Fighting' for freedom
He's good to the core and she's proud
Now our place was a graveyard for automobiles
At the end of the porch there was four stacks of wheels
And tires for sale for a dollar or two
Cash

[Bridge 2]
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof
Me and my family we was living' proof
The people who forgot about poor white trash
And if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

[Chorus]
If that ain't country
It'll harelip the pope
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry
And I've met Johnny Cash
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

You pay for this, but they give you that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The King is gone, but he's not forgotten (Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten)

I don’t stay up late in the middle of the night
Drink from a bottle, half empty as me
I don’t cruise down Villa Place sometimes
Wonder why your car ain’t parked in the street
No way not me I'm way too tough
I ain’t tore up with what went down with us

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, I got no clue what to do
So I stay drunk and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
My mom don't call to check on me
Cause she knows I'm good, yeah, doin’ just fine
And when I see my friends on Demonbreun street
I'm all calm and cool and having a hell of a time
I ain't masquerading your memory
No way no how, no that ain’t me

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now i’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So i stay drink and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Bridge]
I don’t talk to god each night and pray, to him that you’re ok
And Come to think, I don’t think of you at all and wonder where you are today

[Chorus 2]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So I string four cords and the truth, and rhymes and hope it reaches you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
You gotta take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit
You got to take it to the limit one more time

[Verso 1: Kane Brown]
Passed our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts

[Pre-Coro: Becky G & Kane Brown, Kane Brown]
Don't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know I got the key to your heart
In my car, let's go far

[Coro: Becky G & Kane Brown]
Llévame, no importa a donde
Si tú me escondes
Nadie nos podrá encontrar
El viento en la cara, el carro es la cama
Apaga el celular, la luna está llena
La noche esta buena, nadie nos puede parar
Porque el amor no tiene hora y lugar
Lost in the middle of nowhere

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, lost in the middle of nowhere

[Verso 2: Becky G, Kane Brown & Becky G]
Cosquillitas por los pies
¿A dónde vamos?, yo no sé
Contigo, bebé, yo quiero llegar
De medianoche a ese lugar
Nadie sabe dónde estoy
Pero yo contigo voy
Este deseo ya no puede esperar
Hoy nos vamo' a escapar

Llévame, no importa a donde
Si tú me escondes

Porque el amor no tiene hora y lugar
Lost in the middle of nowhere

Oh, lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah

We're young and the highway goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste, it's now or never
No hay tiempo que perder, tan solo dame un beso
Por eso, por eso

[Coro: Becky G & Kane Brown, Becky G]
Llévame, no importa a donde
Si tú me escondes

Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

If I should stay
All my memories, they gather 'round her
I would only be in your way
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water
So I'll go, but I know
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
I'll think of you every step of the way
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye

Country roads

I'll always love you

It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home

You better believe my love is

[Verse 1]
I wasn't raised in a castle
I grew up on the outskirts of town
No dresses with golden tassels
The rings on my hand are handed down
But I'm gonna find the one that needs me, sees me
And treats me like I'm already royalty
There ain't nothing priceless on my wrist
I might not fly private, but that don't mean I ain't a queen

[Chorus]
Queens don't hate, queens don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queens ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queens don't

[Verse 2]
No, I don't need the tallest tower
To prove to anyone I ain't weak
I turn my pain into power
Every tear's a diamond on my cheek

Queens don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh

We had it made in the middle of the madness

Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends

Not even the brightest sun could ever fade

We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

Hits a nerve and lights you up like dynamite

Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell ya why

Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys

Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (slow)
Take the long way home (home)
Get a little too close (close)
We do but - but friends don't

My whole view of the word has changed
I guess that comes with age
I don't believe there is good in every man
Like I did back then

I may drink more than I should
You've seen me on the floor
I've spent my lifetime in this cage
I built around me
Bangin' on the doors

And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living

Heaven knows I broke your heart
I can't take that away
All I'm worth is
Just this promise that I've made to you
To stand beside you
Just like you have stood beside me

And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living

You could be much better off
God knows without me

Come on and share this jam with me

[Connie: Grace Rolek]
Peach or plum or strawberry
Any kind is fine, you see
Come on and share this jam with me
I'll do my best to give this jam the sweetness it deser-er-er-erves

[Steven]
And I'll keep it fresh
I'm jammin' on these tasty preserves

[Steven + Connie]
Ingredients in harmony
We mix together perfectly
Come on and share this jam with me

[Verse 1]
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 2]
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 1]
This ol’ Ruby Rider is Ruby ridin' alone
She’s a sturdy solitary stone
This ol’ Ruby Rider, not a fusion no more
Now the dirt and the dust and the danger is my new home!

[Bridge]
I used to think I would always be by your side
But lately you’ve been rather cold
One look in your eye could make an honest gem cry
But Ruby Rider don’t need no one to hold

[Verse 2]
This ol’ Ruby Rider is Ruby ridin' alone
She’s a sturdy solitary stone

[Verse 1]:
Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well

[Chorus]:
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"

[Verse 2]:
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee"
Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

[Chorus]
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"

[Verse 3]
Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

[Chorus]
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "La, la, la"

[Letra de "La Galliza" ft. El Ezequiel]

[Intro: El Ezequiel]
¡Fntxy!, ¿qué es esa madre loco, es wax?
Échalo pa' acá a la verga, vamos a fumarlo macizo
¡Cozy!, jálate viejón, vente pa' acá loco, vamos a fumar

[Estribillo: El Ezequiel]
Se armó la galliza (Una galliza a la verga)
Cáiganle en verguiza (En verguiza loco)
Ya están los plebones prendiendo los blones
Ya van a empezar (No se aguantan a la verga)
Se armó la galliza (Jálese viejo)
También la waxiza (Viejón)
Ya saqué el wax, date unos dabs, te pone relax
(Bien relax a la verga loco, machín)

[Verso 1: Cozy Cuz]
Con ese gelato me entono
Ando desde morro
Fumando kush en la Lobo
Plumita o en bonga le atoro (Fierro)
Tu morra la robo pa' que me arme unos gordos
De Skywalker los forjo quemando un waxito al modo
Ando bien choro, bien loco, me rifo en los bongazos
Ando bien low bro y acciono el soplete
Ya quemó mi cera y todo lo que pensaba se esfuma
No tengo nada más en que pensar

[Estribillo: El Ezequiel]
Se armó la galliza (Una galliza a la verga)
Cáiganle en verguiza (Se armó la galliza, mija)
Ya están los plebones prendiendo los blones
Ya van a empezar (Macizo a la verga, jálele)
Se armó la galliza (Jálese viejo)
También la waxiza (Viejón)
Ya saqué el wax, date unos dabs, te pone relax
(Bien relax a la verga loco, machín)

[Verso 2: Fntxy]
Mi ropa huele a humo pero todo es nuevo (New shit bro)
Todos los días fumo en restaurantes perros
No aguanto lo agusto pero igual me prendo (Uh, uh, uh)
Una me tranquiliza, otra me quita el sueño
Prendo uno, forjo uno
Quieres Swishers, quiebra el puro (Purrú)
El waxito por el tubo, la flama no la regulo
Saca la plumita de sabor, pero que repitan "Fire Up"

[Estribillo: El Ezequiel]
Se armó la galliza (Una galliza a la verga)
Cáiganle en verguiza (En verguiza loco) (fierro)
Ya están los plebones prendiendo los blones
Ya van a empezar (No se aguantan)
Se armó la galliza (¿Unos gallitos?)
También la waxiza (Date unos dabs a la verga loco)
Ya saqué el wax, date unos dabs, te pone relax
(¿Un gallón o qué?)

[Outro: El Ezequiel]
Andamo' al trillón
Aya verga, que la vieja esta fuma macizo a la verga
¿Eres bien marihuana tú ve'a'?
Marihuanísima, te encanta la verga y la marihuana también
Jálese mija, jálese con unos gallones a la verga
Se armó la galliza mija
Fierro loco a la ver-
¡Y... a la verga loco!
Qué marihuano ando hijo de tu puta madre


Start of song 


She's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers then I lick my fingers

Well, every morning I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in, garbage out; she's gettin' what she wants

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
If I get busy then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself, I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you

Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Driftin' away when I'm talkin' and laughin' as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home

Force fed forced meds till I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her you'll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness

She doesn't know but when she's gone
I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinkin' too
But why, where, and what for, and whom?
And I'm solo rowin' on one side of the boat
Lookin' out, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat

Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?

[Verse 1]
Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red

[Outro]
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I run a lot of miles of life and crime
And mountain climbs and quittin' times
Packing that load of lyin' rhymes
And tired jokes and wooden dimes
I've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend

[Verse 2]
I could lose my house, I could steal a car
I could serve two masters, living hard
Living like a dog in a cage in a yard
With a fist full of cold hard cash that I can't let go
The devil can't have my soul, the devil can't get your soul
The devil can't get your soul

[Chorus]
Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine and then
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

[Verse 3]
When the man comes around and the trumpet sounds
And his number calls and the moment he falls
In the haunted halls of man he will understand
He will comprehend, he will not pretend
He will not pretend

[Verse 4]
When the rain don't fall and the river don't run
And the wind takes orders from the blazing sun
The devil don't break for the fiery snake
And you've had about as goddamn much as you can take
The devil don't take a break, the devil don't take a break
The devil don't take no break

[Chorus]
Hold out your hand
Take hold of mine and then
Round and round we go
Don't you wanna dance
I'm a dying man
From the moment we began
Hold out your hand
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

[Bridge]
Well he came to my door to sell me the fear
With some cameras and bullets and tension and
Here is a license for killing your own native son
For a careless mistake and a fake plastic gun?
(Come on!)
Deliver your brother from violence and greed
For the mountains, lay down for your faith like a seed
A morning is coming of silver and light
There will be color and language and nobody wanting to fight
What a glorious sight!
What a glorious sight!
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

[Chorus]
Hold out your hand (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Take hold of mine and then  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Round and round we go  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Don't you wanna dance  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
I'm a dying man  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
From the moment we began (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Hold out your hand  (ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da


Start of song 


I guess I grew up on an old dirt road
A-pedal to the metal, always did what I's told
'Til I found out that my brand new clothes
A-came second hand from the rich kids next door
And I grew up fast, I guess I grew up mean
There's a thousand things inside my head I wish I ain't seen
And now I just wander through a real bad dream
A-feeling like I'm coming apart at the seams

Well thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heaven
An'a, angels start to look good to me
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deeps

Thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heaven
An'a I know I can't stay here too long
'Cause I can't go a week without doing wrong
(Old Number Seven)
Without doing wrong
(I'm drinking in heaven)
Without doing wrong
(Old Number Seven)
Without doing wrong
(I'm drinking in heaven)

So I'm sitting as the bar stool, it starts to grow roots
I'm feeling like an old worn out pair of shoes
Tell me what is it that I should do
When I'm a-swimming in the liquor only halfway through
So I'm watching as his wings spread as wide as could be
A-come on now and wrap them around me
'Cause all I want to do now is fall to sleep
A-come down here and lay next to me

Thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heaven
An'a up here the bottle never runs dry
And you never wake up with those tears in your eyes
Thank you Jack Daniel's Old Number Seven
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heaven
An'a angels start to look good to me
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deeps
(Old Number Seven)
To the fiery deeps (I'm drinking in heaven)
To the fiery deeps (Old Number Seven)
To the fiery deeps (I'm drinking in heaven)


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
In a world of places, let's go somewhere we haven't gone
We've got younger faces than our hearts are letting on
And we won't place any stock in old days
Let's save up for something new
Someday I won't have to wait for you

[Verse 2]
What if I asked, what if I asked you to stay?
What if it cost you your heart and your last name?
And we won't place any stock in old days
Let's save up for something new
Someday I won't have to wait for you

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
And when we sleep at night, I hope that we write novels in our heads
Of what to tell the other when we wake
And when morning comes before we're done, with volumes left to choose
Let's say "I love you"
Just "I love you"
"I love you"
And "I love you too"


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I've still got your number in my phone
And even though you don't wanna listen
I still call and wait 'til the tone
Just to hear you saying "Leave a message"
Since you've been gone I've had to find different ways to grieve
There's days that I don't even want it on my mind but tonight I’m weak

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing by myself
I can't help that all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you're in a better place
One day I'll see you again
But It's killing me we can't be face to face
I miss my best friend
So tonight

[Chorus]
I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing by myself
I can't help that all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning

[Bridge]
I know it's a part of life
But I wasn't ready to say goodbye
So tonight

[Chorus]
I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing by myself
I can't help that all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning

[Verse 1]
Pictures on her phone and tears in her eyes
Waterproof makeup ain't made for a breakup on a Saturday night
Then it's hey how you been, good how 'bout you
Funny how seeing you once after a few months
Gets you locked out
Right back to telling folks you know I know
All about some new guy taking you out
Then you unfollow me then follow me back
Just so I know you're still around

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

[Verse 2]
Some hearts stay broke, some hearts don't skip a beat
Some people say goodbye then try to make it alright
Just like you're doing to me, but tonight I'm letting it ring

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate, moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do
No some girls never do

[Bridge]
Yeah some girls know when they've got something
Worth holding on to, but some girls never do

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by

Clean slate, moving on to something new

Sometimes some girls make it easy on you

[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along

[Chorus 2]
So girl, hang your dress out to dry
We ain't leaving this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones
Like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

[Chorus]
She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

[Verse 2]
He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

[Chorus]
He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"
Yeah

[Middle 8]
So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

[Chorus]
I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

[Outro]
When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
Ooh

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside
Show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything
More than anything

[Chorus]
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish

[Verse 2]
I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you, in the place you left
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More)
Yeah, more than anything

My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to

She locks you down with just one look
She’s got this whole club undone

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've only just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
Sun is gonna shine above

[Chorus]
And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi
Never got high
Oh, I was a sorry guy
And now, I smile and face the girl that shares my name
Now I'm through with the game
This boy will never be the same

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love

You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign
Strong and kind
And the little boy is mine
Now I see a family where there once was none
Now we've just begun
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love her and she'll bring you luck
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home
Don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money

You bring a tear of joy to my eyes

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams

I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you

[Verse 1]
Walt Grace
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive

Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try

[Chorus]
But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

[Verse 2]
That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home

From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide

[Chorus]
And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

[Verse 3]
One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home

She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side

[Chorus]
And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, 'cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

[Verse 2]
It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next

It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)

Oh, I think it's time to take a heart break, out late

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking about cars and dreaming about women
Never had a plan just a living for the minute

[Chorus]
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about living and a little about love

[Verse 2]
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Come down from your mountain
I miss your holy shouting
These days I can't make you make a sound
Take me to the times when
We'd look up to the skies
And climb up there and draw the thunder down
Now I'm forcing myself into
What you've already been through
But darling I can't help the way I feel
And you need something stronger
A drug to kill the hunger
And ease the awful pain of living here

And I'm the kind of love it hurts to look at
And maybe we should take it as a sign
When I'm strung out on leaving
Exalting all my demons
And you don't care for me enough to cry

I dreamt I'd take you with me
And you'd say you forgive me
And we'd live out some easy, ancient song
Now we're out here unattended
In splendid love’s remembrance
You lost the mind to even do me wrong

And I'm the kind of love it hurts to look at
But once I was enough to make you try
Now I'm underneath the rubble
Trying not to feel the trouble
And you don't care for me enough to cry

So here's hoping I can change tomorrow
You wanted hard as nails cut and dry
But I beg, steal, and borrow
I'm so damn good at sorrow
And you don't care for me enough to cry


Start of song 


Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home

Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
And they fade away

I'll get you back someday

’Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

[Verse 2]
All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you’re happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky

But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever

Yes, they do

A little baby told God
Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if
I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small

Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'

So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom

Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she’s gonna teach everything you’ll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream
And she’ll put you on the path that’ll bring you back to me

So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright

Come on child it’s time to meet your Mom

This is my kinda town, this is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round for more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room with a killer view of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs, but all I can think about is home

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Verse 2]
You should've seen 19th Street, you should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing, when they line dance to "Copperhead Road"
Something about the air down here, that'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw, but all I can think about is you

I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt

Houston, we got a problem

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma

[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Never knew I could feel that much

I wasn’t just broken, I was shattered
I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer love me and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on and I think you were flattered

[Chorus]
Oh! Life’s about joy
Life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved
And love the way I should
Life's about
Life's about to get good

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good

[Verse 2]
The longer my tears fell, the wider the river
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her
I had to believe that things would get better
It was time to forget you, forever

Oh! Life’s about joy
Life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved

It took me so long to be strong
But I'm alive, and I hold on
To what I can feel, it hurts to heal
Oh, when love lies
About to get good
About to get good
About to get...Ahhh

[Chorus]
Oh! Life’s about joy
Life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved
And love the way I should

I dreamed a dream the other night
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
My love, she came, dressed all in white
Lowlands away

[Verse 2]
I dreamed my love came in my sleep
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep
Lowlands away

[Verse 3]
She came to me at my bedside
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
All dressed in white, like some fair bride
Lowlands away

[Verse 4]
And bravely in her bosom fair
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Her red, red rose, my love did wear
Lowlands away

[Verse 5]
She made no sound, no word she said
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
And then I knew my love was dead
Lowlands away

Then I awoke to hear the cry
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Oh, watch on deck, oh, watch, ahoy!
Lowlands away

[Verse 1]
Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still ought to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
These days it's all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 2]
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
"Are you sure Hank done it this way?"

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Bridge]
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?

Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes

Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again

Cause he's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true
I was made for you

I climbed across the mountaintops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you

Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess

No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through
Like you do, and I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

Oh but these stories don't mean anything

And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave

There's still time
For you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave

And it's hard to resist
All right, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave

Like a devil on a shoulder
You keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's getting kinda hard for me
To do the right thing, yeah
I wanna do the right thing baby

Sun on your skin
It's six am
And I've been watching you sleep

Honey, I'm so afraid
You're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave

Cause I know you
And you know me

Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, "Let's leave it long in the back"
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything

Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing "Already Gone" at the Forum in LA

Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be

Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came

Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day
The words came out; they couldn't be erased
Saw the pain in your eyes, and I knew everything had changed

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a traitor, I'm the cause
I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if

Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Verse 2]
It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit that you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if

Sometimes I go over the lines
And I won't make it back 'til the next day

But I cast no stones
What gives you the right?
To tell me my business
Good God man, you're out of your mind
So put up your Bible
Or let me get mine
I'm not dragging the whole world to hell
And wasting my time

I don't talk with Jesus
As much as I should
I don't read that good book
Every day like I could
But I like to stop
At the end of the day
I pray that I hurt nobody
And somebody new found their way

But I cast no stones

Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink, not looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darling
You don't want a heart

Oo-oo

Hey there Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now

You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega

Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

We've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots

The break down, wrong turn that takes ya

A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way

[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is
Only given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She is headed for the cheating side of town

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 2]
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms
They fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 3]
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes

[Verse]
Well baby, there you stand
With your little head, down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy too well, farewell
So you live from day to day, and you dream
About tomorrow, oh

And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind from wondering what
I left behind and from worrying about this wasted time

Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
You got to leave it alone"

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

[Verse 1]
Well I'm packin' up my game and I'mma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'mma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' "Chillin' the Most"
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and get tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I want to be a

[Chorus]
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

[Verse 2]
I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me

[Chorus]
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!
Ride at night cause I sleep all day!
Cowboy, baby!
I can smell a pig from a mile away

[Verse 3]
Yeah!
Kid Rock you can call me Tex
Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's
Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass
And said "Yeah this dick fits right in your ass"
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right
I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors ball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure
I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and
Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean

[Chorus]
Cowboy, baby!
With the top let back and the sunshine shinin'
Cowboy, baby!
West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine
I want to be a Cowboy, baby!

I love it when she raps to an Eminem song (Eminem song)

Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl, yeah

Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite

Making all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what

Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four-wheel drive
A country boy can survive

Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Does she wake up, put on make-up in the bathroom
And go to work, and stay real late and text you she'll be back soon?
But her boss runs his fingers 'round her pretty blonde platinum 'do
I bet you never thought about that, did you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's none of my business
And I don't wanna get involved
If you're thinking that she's good
I think you should be told

She's got you on your knees like a little boy
Everybody sees that you're just a little toy
She’s got a boxful that her daddy likely bought
She asks you if you love her, and you nod and say "Uh huh"

[Verse 2]
She wears short skirts so you don't ask her if you can check her phone
Talk about the guys at work so you feel ego-central
Like fancy cars and football teams is she like continental
With a European accent does she speak, oh so gentle

And it's none of my business
And I don't wanna get involved
If you're thinking that she's good

That while she's out at work, she's doing what you did to me

We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take no trips on LSD;
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
But, We love living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;

But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, it really rocked my world

Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way

One girl, 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace,to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue

You never see it coming, it happens all of a sudden
And when it finally hits you, it's too late
He just sat there in the silence, on his own private island
I wasn't ready for the storm about to break
Yesterday, there was no trace of trouble
Now he's given up more than I can take

He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

[Verse 2]
Nobody showed me, nobody told me
What to do when the story turned out wrong
Or how a heart does its mending, without the perfect ending
The one I always thought would come along
He had his own ideas of where this love was going
He wasn't leaving it up to the hands of fate

Wanna get the most of all to gratify your desire
Wanna get the most admiration, the biggest slice

Wanna get the 24/7 full-on limelight
By giving up your private life

Wanna get response and praise and virtual embraces

Wanna get your kicks out of pics people share in reply

Don't give yourself away and your personality
If someone pulls the plug you'll end up sad and lonely
On your couch in the hotspot front row
Think you're a hero and you really want the world to know
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend, your friend
Wanna get the fame of a VIP and you're paying the price
But it's just fame in a frame till your batterie dies
Wanna get the max of clicks and you chat and you chase
But when I talk to you, you can't even look in my face
Without your device you don't know how to think
Gotta check your insta friends, 'cause you're an influenced thing
But you never get what you see when they're posing real cool
Get a life you little fool

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Bridge]
A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

[Chorus]
Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots

I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

Forgiveness of sin in Your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way You made sure
All my roads led to her

So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, amen
And thank God for this woman, amen

Gonna make everything alright
And I ain't got no worries cause I ain't in no hurry at all

Well, if it rains, I don't care! Don't make no difference to me

Yeah, I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland

Earth has no sorrow

All who are broken
Lift up your face
Oh wanderer come home
You're not too far
So lay down your hurt
Lay down your heart
Come as you are

There's hope for the hopeless

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye!"
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 3]
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 4]
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: "Why, why, why?"
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

[Letra de "Los Chismes"]

[Verso 1]
Nada más abrí la boca que ya estaba por casarme
Y la gente que es curiosa terminó por preguntarme
Al saber quién es la novia ya querían desanimarme
Dicen que eres algo ciega pero no me importa tanto
Yo te quiero pa' mi esposa, no para tirar al blanco
Cuando no me veas me tientas pa' que sepas por en 'onde ando

[Coro]
A mí los chismes me vienen flojos
Y no me importa lo que digan por ahí
Te quiero mucho, bien de mi vida
Y nunca nadie me podrá alejar de ti

[Interludio]
Y no te abrigues chiquita que estando bien con Dios
Los santos valen un cero a la izquierda, sí, señor

[Verso 2]
También dicen que eres fea, eso a mí no me interesa
Porque nunca te he querido pa' concurso de belleza
Aunque fueras cacariza, para mí eres mi princesa
Por ahí dicen que eres flaca, eso ya me lo sabía
Al cabo que no te quiero pa' poner carnicería
Si quisiera una gordita sé que me la conseguía
Me dijeron que estás prieta y que no te voy a mirar
Yo tengo mucho dinero y te mando a niquelar
Para que relampaguees y te vea en la oscuridad

[Coro]
A mí los chismes me vienen flojos
Y no me importa lo que digan por ahí
Te quiero mucho, bien de mi vida
Y nunca nadie me podrá alejar de ti

Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Oh, oh, love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Oh, oh, love hurts

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Oh, oh, love hurts
Oh, oh, love hurts

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Oh, oh, love hurts

Oh, oh

The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

Like your dress on the floor
Yeah the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms

And make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that

And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

[Verse 2]
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

[Verse 4]
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 6]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

[Verse 7]
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
It's like I'm walking on a high wire, staring straight into the sun
With the universe around me waiting for me to fall down
Your love is like a junkie, juggling a loaded gun
Your words are like a whiskey river rolling off of your tongue

[Chorus]
But you won't burn out this starfire
There’s fearless dancing in my flames
Blow me out, I'll just burn brighter
Oh, you can't burn out this starfire
No matter what you say

[Verse 2]
I won't ever be perfection, ever be your golden child
I'm not spinning on this planet just to merely make you smile
I love my crooked halo, hell, I won't apologize
You can touch it all you want, but no matter how hard you try

You won't burn out this starfire
There’s fearless dancing in my flames
Blow me out, I'll just burn brighter

You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out

You ain't ever, oh nah, nah, nah

We stayed in Number 4 Ferdinand Street
We spent five talking 'bout our lives
But we'd talked like that about a thousand times
And I'm bored of all that

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
And you got your numbers

I'll tell you about a guy
That I've been with
You ask "How old is he?"
And I laugh, "26"
"Nah, but he’s 30
How messed up is that?"
"Oh, forget it" he says
"I'm a jealous man
And I don't want to talk about that"

Hold on real tight

A couple of pretty flowers
That's what I brought to you
I saw you through a broken window
With a different point of view
You had signs of depression
From a long line of sin
And your face tells a story
'Bout the places you have been
I love you so
I thought you should know

And that muddy water's flowin'
As you take my hand
Past the creek down by the holler
Through your daddy's land
I could buy you a diamond
But I cannot change the world
'Cuz I ain't got no money
You'll never be my girl no no
I thought you should know

You was gonna be a singer
And a big movie star
But you can't catch no breaks baby
And Hollywood is hard
Now you work down at the Timeout
Off 155
And you're dancing for your dollar
Just tryin' to stay alive
It hurts me so
I thought you should kno
W
You feed your addiction
With your crystal meth
And I plead for your life
As it takes you to your death
You make your deal with the devil
As your looks begin to fade
I saw you laughin' through the tears
As you slowly slipped away
I watched you go
I thought you should know
Yeah I watched you go
I thought you should know

That cold rain is pourin'
As they lay you in the grave
And I can barely recognize you
In your fragile state

No more signs of depression
From a long time ago
I throw in a pretty flower
As they slowly laid you low
It was a rose
I thought you should know
Yeah it was a rose
I thought you should know

A couple of pretty flowers
That's what I brought to you
I saw you through a broken window
With a different point of view

Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

To say that you are cute
Would be like saying that a strawberry is sweet
Because a strawberry has secret flavors
That are sharp, and tart, and red, and deep

And I would love to find you
Growing wild out by the woods
I would make a basket with the front of my t-shirt
And take home as many of you as I could

And to say that you are pretty
Would be like saying that the ocean is blue
Because the ocean is filled with all kinds of colors
And I see all kinds of things when I look at you

And I want to explore you
With my tennis shoes off
Standing ankle deep in a tide pool with my khaki pants rolled up

And to say that you are funny
Would be like saying that the night sky is black
Because the night sky is filled with stars and comets
And planets that no one has seen yet

And I want to look at you
Lying down on my front lawn
I'll try to take you all in at once
But you just go on and on and on

Look up in that Carolina sky

Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet

I still remember what he used to say

[Chorus]
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

[Bridge]
It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul
We'll get you a sip and let the whiskey take control

[Chorus]
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
Just let the moonshine
And let the moonshine

[Verse 1]
I don't know if there's somebody else
Cause we never said nothin' bout nobody else
But for me there ain't nobody else
Cause I fell that hard for you
I don't know if you want what I want
If you're letting me in or you're leading me on
I don't know where this is going
But I know where I want it to

[Pre-Chorus]
The clock ain't reversing
I light up when you say
"Do you wanna stay the night tonight?"

[Chorus]
City girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do
You tell your friends all about it like it's only going out
I'm just another Friday night
Another someone to call
It's such a fine line playing it cool
Not pushing too hard
I'm breaking my own heart
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl

[Verse 2]
2AM, hear the buzz of your phone
I don't have to ask cause I already know
That he's just like me, but tonight he's alone
Cause I'm with you
Yeah, I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch that sunrise
Coming through your blinds
Just another hour or two

[Chorus]
Yeah, city girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do
You tell your friends all about it like it's only going out

Not pushing too hard
I'm breaking my own heart
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl

[Bridge]
I could take you out for coffee
We could talk about whatever
It don't have to be your heart, girl
We could talk about the weather
Baby, I don't wanna scare you
I'm not tryna' lock you down
I just want your time
And I don't wanna leave right now

[Chorus]
City girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do

[Verse 1]
Hadn't talked in a couple days
It was a pretty big fight
But you showed up at my place
Like we were gonna make it alright
You had a bottle of wine, a fire in your eyes
You were slippin' off you high-heeled shoes
We were tangled up all night, till the sun came through

[Chorus]
We barely even made it down the hall
The way you had your hands all over me, yeah
Girl we didn't get no sleep at all
You were holdin' on like you were never gonna leave
I thought we were makin' up and makin' love
'Cause that's always the best
Baby, how was I supposed to know
We were having breakup sex

[Verse 2]
You were goin' crazy
And now I know why
It was so damn good baby
'Cause you were saying goodbye

[Chorus]
We barely even made it down the hall
The way you had your hands all over me, yeah
Girl we didn't get no sleep at all
You were holdin' on like you were never gonna leave
I thought we were makin' up and makin' love
'Cause that's always the best
Baby, how was I supposed to know
We were having breakup sex

[Bridge]
Yeah, I wish you would have stayed but if you had to walk away
Baby what a way to go

Breakup sex

[Chorus]
We barely even made it down the hall
The way you had your hands all over me, yeah
Girl we didn't get no sleep at all

[Verse 1]
Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Bridge]
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Don't wanna hear that stupid melody
The one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'Cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
Where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
Don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'Cause once I do, I know it won't leave me alone
It haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
But still, I just can't make myself delete it from my phone

[Chorus]
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know, I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song that we made love to
That we made love to, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I'm contradicting everything I said
But I wanna turn it up when I'm lyin' in this bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

[Chorus]
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It breaks me, it makes me
Wanna hear it again and again and again
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, "This is where rednecks come from"
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days

[Verse 2: Babeo Baggins]
I stopped my rambling
Never been once a gambler, my town
But for you, for you, for you, just once
It might be fine these days
These days

[Verse 3: Drake]
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days

[Verse 4: Both]
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days

[Verse 5: Babeo Baggins & Drake]
I've had lovers
I've had lovers, one after another
But this time, me, myself and I are just fine
These days
These days

[Verse 6: Drake]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days
These days


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
She'll take you in, feed your friends
Her open arms are welcoming
She'll rub your back all night when you're crying
She'll listen to you tell your story
Hold your fear and all your worries
Help you find the truth when they're all lying
Even when it's hopeless, she keeps trying

[Chorus]
She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother

[Verse 2]
She fixes all the broken things
When you're in love, she's got a ring
To give to you, she hopes you'll give away
She don't care who you give it to
Where they're from, if they pray like you
As long as they are good to you, that's enough
First thing she taught you was love is love

[Chorus]
She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother

[Bridge]
When you fail her, when you're afraid
And crying in the careless mess you've made
She'll make you clean it up yourself and offer you a little help
And dry your weary eyes when you let her
But she'll look at you and know you can do better

[Chorus]
She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
And the secrets in your heart she's always known

[Outro]
She's a beacon, a harbour
A lighthouse, her armour
A promise and a blanket when it's cold
You'll understand it more when you get older
You've got each other
That's your mother
You've got each other
That's your mother

[Verse 1]
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

[Verse 2]
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

[Verso 1]
Pa' no ponerme a pensar
Mejor me pongo a fumar
Hierbita mala, cómo me encanta
Nadie sabe los problemas que hay en casa
De fresa me gusta más
En un papel especial color dorado
Me va pegando
El efecto del humito va ingresando

[Estribillo]
Si me quedo callado es porque ya llegué al espacio
En menos de un minuto me pongo bien marihuano
Aquí no hay fijón, si ando grifo estoy relajado

[Verso 2]
Las calles del East LA
Ay, como las extrañé
Y en la escuelita dejé la clica
Esas rayas con hechos me las gané
La vida se va y ni hablar
Si la pierdo me da igual
Y este leñito se lo dedico
A los que se adelantaron en el camino

Si me quedo callado es porque ya llegué al espacio
En menos de un minuto me pongo bien marihuano
Aquí no hay fijón, si ando grifo estoy relajado, marihuano

It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right

8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', "Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I’m really needin' now

Chase that disco ball around

I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop

A pointing dog down in the old logging road
And Danny got three and looked back a-grinning
I fumbled around and I tried to reload
The country was cold with the sun westward sinking
It's good to be back in this place
With my hands around a Belgian made Browning
My mind on the lines of her face

[Verse 2]
Well now Danny's my buddy
We grew up like family
Hunted this timber before we could drive
And the old English Pointer, he once belonged to me
But I give him up when i moved in '05
Off with a girl
Off to the city
Off on a wing and a chance
Hell, I thought it'd play out just like some story
We fell in love at a rodeo dance

[Chorus]
She said, "Go on back to Cherokee County
Won't you crawl back with nothing but a razor and a comb"
Says, "Babe, If you need me I'll be where you found me
Go on to hell, honey, I'm headed home"

[Verse 3]
Dan says, "Look at ol' Jim
A dozen Decembers behind him no worse for the wear
And your time spent in Tulsa did not help your shooting
And look at the gray in your hair
How good does it feel?
You belong in these hills
It's best that you let it all end
If you'd married that girl, you'd have married her family
You dodged a bullet my friend"

[Chorus]
She said, "Go on back to Cherokee County
Won't you crawl back with nothing but a razor and a comb"
Says, "Babe, If you need me I'll be where you found me
Go on to hell, honey, I'm headed home"

[Verse 4]
Ah, and I was beginning to deal with it ending
The old dog had pointed while part of me died
And a flutter of feathers
Then a shotgun to shoulder
I thought of the Fourth of July
She'll be home on the Fourth of July
I bet we'll dance on the Fourth of July

[Pre-Chorus]
Dan says, "Hell of a shot, looks like you still got it
That's what we came here to do
Well, it's light enough still, at the foot of the hill
We could kick up a single or two"

[Chorus]
She said, "Go on back to Cherokee County
Won't you crawl back with nothing but a razor and a comb"
Says, "Babe, If you need me I'll be where you found me
Go on to hell, honey, I'm headed home
Go on to hell, honey, I'm headed home"

[Verse 1]
When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, "Yeah girls he's come a long way"
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 4]
These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy

Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy

If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

[Verse 2]
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston,
And New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And its time we stand and say

[Chorus]
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

[Chorus - Outro]
And I'm proud to be and American
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land

Ya Allah
Berikanlah daku petunjuk
Agar bisa ku
Meneruskan hidup
Agar bisa ku
Berjalan di jalan yang lurus

Andainya ku bisa putarkan saat waktu
Ku perbetulkan segala kesilapan lalu
Andainya ku pernah melukan hatimu
Izinkan aku mengubati jiwa ragamu
Segala-gala suka dan duka
Tak pernah dapat ku lupa
Daku manusia biasa
Dan pergi bawa dosa pahala
Hidup di dunia cuma sementara
Janganlah leka jangan terpedaya
Antara kaca dan juga permata

Susun sepuluh jari memohon diampuni
Janganlah bersedih berduka
Berjumpa dia sama semula
Kembali kepada pencipta
Di padang yang luas terbuka
Di hitung syurga dan neraka
Mengapa kau bersedih berduka
Di jiwa gelora di dalam delema menanggung derita

Yeah, you've been alone
I've been gone for far too long
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you
Never let it show
The pain I've grown to know
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I've waited so long just to come hold you
I'm making it through, it's been far too long
We've proven our love over time's so strong
In all that we do
The stars in the night, they lend me their light
To bring me closer to heaven with you

That's just how it's supposed to be
He hates dumb tea parties
And she won't climb a tree

[Chorus]
It's a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

[Verse 2]
She'll stop wearin' pigtails
And get the braces off her teeth
He'll stop makin' faces
And start savin' her a seat

It's a boy and a girl thing
A girl and a boy thing

[Verse 3]
She'll start wearin' makeup
And he'll start noticin' the curves
They'll get a little nervous
When she's with him and he's with her

Is he gonna kiss me?
Wonder if she wants me to?
Awkwardly embarrassed
Not sure what to do

Start a brand new life together

And even when they're eighty

Yeah, I'll make believe, re-write history
Ignite a spark I can't undo
It always starts out simple like a conversation
Before I know it, I'm lost in your illumination

[Chorus]
If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are, I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse, you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that

You're a carnival on a summer night
Gone too soon every time
Yeah, it's beautiful how you burn so bright
In the waste land you leave behind

If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet, uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country)
I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun)
But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder)
The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill)
God, what have I become? (Whoooa)
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the vanity
I trusted America, she took my sanity

[Hook: Lee Brice]
Winds of change rollin' in
Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen
Just a bow for your violin
You played me
You made me your violin

She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She said she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife (He runs around town)
But he runs around town (Lies, lies)
He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy)
She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her)
But no one believes her (Whoa)
A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter “To hell I send thee”
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen

Uh, used like a rag
I've been washed up, I've dragged
Through the mud like a thief
My beliefs and my loves
Take it up, take it down
Took a left, took a right
It's the one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made are mine
But I swear that all cannot be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Take away everything from me
And ask why more?
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
As I'm praying, I'm saying “Why Lord?”
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and fight more
I'll travel a long road
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You played me
Uh, 'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You made me
Your violin

He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

[Verse 2]
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

[Chorus]
My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

I know one day we'll meet again

I couldn't help but notice you were sitting by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona like you're trying to get over somebody else
It's funny how your story sounds a little like mine
Oh, cause' I've been at a table with a bottle peeling labels to pass the time

[Pre-Chorus]
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But if we're gonna be alone

[Chorus]
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together

I couldn't help but notice you could use another drink
Yeah, I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila, so what you think?

She said, "It's none of my business but it breaks my heart"
Dropped a dozen cheap roses in my shopping cart
Made it out to the truck without breaking down
Everybody knows you in a speed trap town

Well it's a Thursday night but there's a high school game
Sneak a bottle up the bleachers and forget my name
These 5A bastards run a shallow cross
It's a boy's last dream and a man's first loss

And it never did occur to me to leave 'til tonight
And there's no one left to ask if I'm alright
I'll sleep until I'm straight enough to drive, then decide
If there's anything that can't be left behind

The doctor said Daddy wouldn't make it a year
But the holidays are over and he's still here
How long can they keep you in the ICU?
Veins through the skin like a faded tattoo

Was a tough state trooper 'til a decade back
When that girl who wasn't Mama caused his heart attack
He didn't care about us when he was walking around
Just pulling women over in a speed trap town

But it never did occur to me to leave 'til tonight
When I realized he'll never be alright
Sign my name and say my last goodbye, then decide
That there's nothing here that can't be left behind

The road got blurry when the sun came up
So I slept a couple hours in the pickup truck
Drank a cup of coffee by an Indian mound
A thousand miles away from that speed trap town
A thousand miles away from that speed trap town

I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gon' drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

[Verse 1]
Well, maybe it'll make me lose my mind
Well, maybe it'll help me forget this time
Well, maybe it'll put my fist through the wall
Make me pick up the phone and give you a call
Maybe it'll take me somewhere I've never been
Make the world stand still, and make the whole room spin
Maybe make me dance, make me cry
Hell, I don't know, but I know tonight

[Chorus]
I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it'll buy this bar a round
Or turn my ass upside down
Maybe it'll make me a fly on the wall
Or stand me up ten feet tall
Maybe it'll take me to a better place
And put a smile back on my face
Maybe it'll make me hate myself
Or fall in love with somebody else

[Chorus]
But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

And maybe it'll talk me off the ledge I've been on lately
Maybe it'll heal me, maybe it'll kill me, yeah, maybe

But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
And drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

I wanna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

You're laying here with me cause
You're hearts inside my hand but
You're too afraid to leap

I, oh I've gotta let you go
I, oh I've gotta let you go

Tell me does he write you
A song called you're my girl
Or sing about you every night
All around this world

Tell me does he hold you

Oh no

And you've had a little too much to drink
You give me a call

Please don't hang up the phone

If I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me
I don't believe we've ever even met
If there's a God in heaven, you can show me
Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet
There are moments I could hold you forever
And there are moments that lasted way too long
There are days when I change with the weather
To hold you in place would be wrong

[Chorus]
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too

[Verse 2]
I never met a morning I could get through
With nothing on my breath to hold the night
And I never said I'm sorry, but I meant to
I never met a coward I don't like
There are reasons why a body stays in motion
But at the moment, only demons come to mind
There are days when I could walk into the ocean
With no one else but you to leave behind

[Chorus]
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too


Start of song 


Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah-ho what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Will you come with me
Won't you come with me
Woah-ho what I want to know
Will you come with me?

God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah-ho what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, heads all empty, and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river; knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine

[Verse 1]
Darling remember, when you come to me
I'm the pretender; I'm not what I'm supposed to be
But who could know if I'm a traitor?
Time's the revelator

[Verse 2]
They caught the Katy, and left me a mule to ride
The fortune lady came along, she walked beside
But every word seemed to date her
Time's the revelator, the revelator

[Verse 3]
Up in the morning, up and on the line
Drive into Corning, and all the spindles whine
And everyday is getting straighter
Time's the revelator, the revelator

[Verse 4]
Leaving the valley, and fucking out of sight
I'll go back to Cali where I can sleep out every night
And watch the waves and move the fader
Time's the revelator, the revelator

Queen of fakes and imitators
Time's the revelator

[Chorus 1]
In constant sorrow all through his days
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I bid farewell to San Francisco
The place where I was born and raised
(The place where he was borned and raised)

[Verse 1]
I'm almost never in the city I was born and bred in anymore but everywhere I tour
I'm repping black and orange
I'm trekking back and forth forgetting what I'm packing for
I have to travel more and add a couple saddle sores
Got these battle scars from riding in the cattle car
You're noshing on some caviar
I'm gnawing on your apple cores
Mental checklist
You're Mr. International
But last I checked I'm Mr. Continental Breakfast
Condiments and Chex mix
Condoms but I'm sexless
But I'm optimistic
I'll dismiss my bigger issues
If I fit into some mistress like the long block in Tetris
I was roaming in Wyoming when the popo were arresting me
I told em questing for my destiny-- Noo
I always end up in detention cause I'm itching
And I'm searching for adventure and each city I go

[Chorus 2]
It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die (die) upon this train
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

[Verse 2]
Papa is a head doctor. I think he's Socrates
But he can't get my twin brother to want to talk to me
But I rarely try and so it's partly my hippocracy
Gotta a couple secrets and I keep them under lock and key
Push em down occasionally sparking up the broccoli
I'd rather take my lumps display dirty laundry
Than pop a pill and stagger through this day like I'm zombie
Like I'm some unhappy and unnatural Blondie Abercrombie model with the fake-est fucking smile plastered on me
I might be a sarcastic bastard, but I'm never plastic
And my masochist tendency's
Imagining disaster and then mastering its recipe
So I hit the road out of necessity to stop guarding
And I'll hop out and run if ever my car is not starting
For now I'm not charging
All my meals are business meals
Cause my business is not starving

[Chorus 3]
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
(While he is sleeping in his grave)

[Verse 3]
4AM again, the radio alarm is kicking in
I've been to every shitty old La Quinta Inn in Michigan
Hitting the ignition till I'm stripping off my Michelins
If you catch me bitching then remind me
How magnificent my life is
How the struggle's priceless
Cause I got those lovely troubles that you couldn't put a damper on
Each unhappy camper on this planet is a champion
If you think you're hopeless and you'll never be like Kobe and you
And you’ve got an empty mantle cause you never won a trophy man
Well you still won that marathon of swimming that fallopian
And I've learned lot I could lose
Cause there's a lot of dead sperm in the socks that I've used
Who would love to be the feet in the socks in my shoes
So better get to walking till those spoiled feet are bruised
And then sow your royal oats till you're growing something new

[Chorus 4]
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(That golden California shore)


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
At night when the lake is a mirror
And the moon rides the waves to the shore
A single soul sets his voice singing
Content to be slightly forlorn

[Verse 2]
A song rises over the lilies (Waa-ooh waa-ooh)
Sweeps high to clear over the reeds
And over the bulrushes swaying
To pluck at a pair of heartstrings

[Verse 3]
Two voices, now they are singing
Then ten, as the melody soars
Round the shimmering pond all are joining in song
As it carries their reverie on

[Verse 4]
Over the treetops and mountains
Over the blackened ravines
Then softly it falls by a house near a stream
And over the garden wall

To thee...

It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, "y'all, remember to wipe your feet!"
And then she said, "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
And mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And mama said to me, "Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

[Chorus]
I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man

[Verse 2]
Yeah there's an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

[Chorus]
I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man
[Outro]
I got the first kiss and she’ll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man

Charleston girl in a darkened room
And you don't know her like I do
We took the fire escape to her room
And got stone-raging blind

Left my money in the trusting hands
Of them old Steele Brothers in a 'fastgrass' band
One day I'm gonna drive up there
And give them half my mind

I don't know if it's the wine or the coke
That makes her sound like her jaw is broke
She's working hard to make some sense
But she ain't got a dime

I wish to God that I could help her out
I wish I knew what she was talkin' bout
I wish to God that I could get away
But I'm way too drunk to drive

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why, but every time I cross that river, Lord
There's somethin' tears me up and makes me wild

Charleston girl with raven hair
Bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys
I'd try to drive away

I never planned to leave so soon
I didn't know that he was sweet on you
Go ahead and take her
Cause she ain't worth the time

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Wading through the waste, stormy winter
And there's not a friend to help you through
Trying to stop the waves behind your eyeballs
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues

Thank you for your wine, California
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits
Yes I've got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my shoe

[Chorus]
But come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
Come on, honey child, I beg of you
Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya
You've got to scrape that shit right off you shoes

[Saxophone Solo]
I want you to come on and sing it with me one time...
All right

Yes, I want you to come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
I said I want you to come on, honey child, I beg of you
I want you come on, honey child you've got it in you
You've got to scrape that shit right off you shoes

One more time
Hey

Just who it is calming, callin' my name now

My head fallin' under a blanket of shame

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going
High and low may I go

The people around me won't let me
Become what I need to, they want me the same
I look at myself and I want to
Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name

[Verse 4]
The stones in the sky never worry
They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say

I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town

So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home

So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, we'll never leave dry land

So just lay it out, what's it about?

Acting like it isn't when we know it is

You're all that I ever wanted
Let's go and put a label on it

Know we took a little time
There's more clothes of yours than mine
In my closet now, I don't know how
We didn't do this sooner
Yeah, there ain't nothing cooler than having you around
Up in this house, yeah

When you're looking at me that way

She rolls with it

Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Verse 2]
Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Bridge]
Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you

[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah

Oh, I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

[Verse 1]
You pick the time and the place
Don't know how much this hurts
I gave him my heart to break
Now I know he broke yours first
Lyin' right there in my bed
While he was lying to you
Believing the words that he said
How could we be such fools?

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you

[Chorus]
Diane
I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band
Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

[Verse 2]
You can blame me if it helps
That's what a good wife would do
But you're only cheating yourself
Choosing him over the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you

I promise I didn't know he was your man

O, poor old man

Says I, "Old man, your horse will die."
And we say so, and we know so
And if he dies, we'll tan his hide
O, poor old man

And if he don't, I'll ride him again
And we say so, and we know so
And I'll ride him, 'til the Lord knows when
O, poor old man

O, he's dead as a nail in the lamp room door
And we say so, and we know so
And he won't come worrying us no more
O, poor old man

[Verse 5]
We'll use the hair of his tail to sew our sails
And we say so, and we know so
And the iron of his shoes to make deck nails
O, poor old man

[Verse 6]
We'll rop him down with a long long ro'
And we say so, and we hope so
Where the sharks have his body and the devil takes his soul!

Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on

Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

[Verse 2]
Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it’s fine, I don’t mind, 'cause you changed everything

Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away

[Verse 1: Upchurch]
Six foot deep, deep deep in the cut
Shovel and a tarp rolled up in the truck
Couple old bikers and they know whats up
Spin my iTunes, shake em, I'm getting people roughed up
And a child molester might end up in the mud
Bones in the shit of a couple wild boars
Teeth buried in the lot of a little white church
I be somewhere dog GPS don’t work
When the cops all do things a little bit dirty
But they stay on my team, I got that baby face money
Y'all can buy all that jewelry, I’ll invest in my community
Put a bunker in the ground, fill it up with plenty shiny things
I got brass for days, pitbulls with teeth so razor sharp you’d think
My females slept with a great white shark
I ain’t tryna brag but my A-Team too big
Some crazy mother fuckers on that 1900’s shit
It’s time for a change, ya I came with some buddies
Who don’t mind getting muddy and bloody and standin' for somethin'
And putting some sense into this corrupt country
Go ahead big dog come over here and say somethin'

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away

[Verse 2: Adam Calhoun]
You can get it, I'ma fight until the death of me
I ain’t never been on the run from an enemy
Heavily armed to the teeth, got an army with me
And I’m ready to die if you threaten me
AK’s, AR’s, you ain’t who you say you are
Bullets start flying, putting ghosts in the graveyard (Boo)
Full moon lighting up the battlefield
Battle to my last breath and my blood splatter here (Boo)
Just breathe a minute
Just think a minute
You don’t wanna go to war
Or we could get it, yeah we could bring it right to your front door
I don’t think you wanna go that route
I ain’t known to fuck around, fuck around
I'ma throw a hundred rounds
Put your cold body in the fuckin' ground
Get the point bitch, when I hit you with the hollow round
What the fuck you talkin' bout?
I don’t wanna talk about it
Leave your body right there layin' with some chalk around it
Why I gotta go so hard?
Why you so fuckin' soft?
Call your man runnin' bitch, you already fuckin' lost

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do I'ma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motherfucker standin' in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away
I never ran away

Hey man them ain't high heel sneakers
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots
And that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues

[Verse 2]
You're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
Well gay guitar pickers don't turn me on
And we don't all get into Donna Summer
Do you happen to know any ol' Hank Williams songs?

[Chorus]
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
I should have died out a long time before
Have pity on a dinosaur
Hand me my hat, excuse me man, but where's the door?

[Verse 3]
Used to be, I had a lot of fun in this old hangout
We'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay out of fights
Now and then, light a little smoke in the truck out back (Aww)
Then a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right

[Verse 4]
And you know these flashin' lights sure make me dizzy
And this disco's very strange to my ears
It looks like they've turned the Longhorn into a spaceship
And I'll be leavin' just as soon as I finish this beer

[Chorus]
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
Should have died out a long time before
There's a whole lot of dinosaurs

Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day

And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love

Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?

Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

I wanna climb all the way up your family tree

'Cause if I had my druthers
I'd buttfuck both your brothers
Then I'd grab your sister
Take her out back and fist her
Go down on your mama
Start a whole lotta drama
Save your dad for last
So I can eat out his ass

Don't mean to upset you
Don't mean to offend
Can you talk to your family and see if they're in?
All the dinners and the parties
I always felt they liked me
I wanna nail everyone in your family tree

Don't need your lovin'
Rather suck off all your cousins
Then I'll grab your auntie
Finger fuck her through her panties
Then I'll grab Uncle Andy
Reach around give him a handy
Give your grandpa a call
So I can tickle his balls

And I know it's a sin
Girl you're real special
I rather be with your kin
I think your sister likes me
She smiles at me and then she goes down

[Verse 1]
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me

Oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?

[Verse 1]
Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner

First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway

[Refrain / Outro]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

[Verse 1]
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

You know, I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go
Hold on till the end"
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
Here's to the brokens
The misfits and wannabes
The part of you that's just like me
The wallflowers and the holier than thou's
To the diamonds that are never gonna leave the rough
The rolling stones that are always stuck
The all nighters and the lost I've never found

[Chorus]
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess

[Verse 2]
Here's to the waiting
All the waiting that we have to do
The dreams we make that never come true
And all the hurting that comes without warning
Here's to the view from the tile of the bathroom floor
Ain't we all been there before?
And the hell bent sun that's gonna come up the next morning

[Chorus]
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess

[Bridge]
Most the time I forget to pray
But when I close my eyes, I just say
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get

[Chorus]
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

Mmm, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

[Chorus]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Outro: Timbaland]
Ha ha, it's gon' get (uglyy - in here!)
Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (ugly - in here!)
(Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (ugly) say what?
(Ugly, ugly) Say what? (Ugly!) In here! Huh, in here!
(It's gon' get ugly - in here!)

Start of song 


[Verse 1: Brandi Carlile]
I was a Highwoman
And a mother from my youth
For my children, I did what I had to do
My family left Honduras when they killed the Sandinistas
We followed a coyote through the dust of Mexico
Every one of them except for me survived
And I am still alive

[Verse 2: Amanda Shires]
I was a healer
I was gifted as a girl
I laid hands upon the world
Someone saw me sleeping naked in the noon sun
I heard "witchcraft" in the whispers and I knew my time had come
The bastards hung me at the Salem gallows hill
But I am living still

[Verse 3: Yola]
I was a freedom rider
When we thought the South had won
Virginia in the spring of '61
I sat down on the Greyhound that was bound for Mississippi
My mother asked me if that ride was worth my life
And when the shots rang out, I never heard the sound
But I am still around

[Chorus]
And I'll take that ride again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 4: Natalie Hemby]
I was a preacher
My heart broke for all the world
But teaching was unrighteous for a girl
In the summer, I was baptized in the mighty Colorado
In the winter, I heard the hounds and I knew I had been found
And in my Savior's name, I laid my weapons down
But I am still around

[Verse 5: All]
We are The Highwomen
Singing stories still untold
We carry the sons you can only hold
We are the daughters of the silent generations
You send our hearts to die alone in foreign nations
And they return to us as tiny drops of rain
But we will still remain

[Chorus]
And we'll come back again
And again, and again, and again, and again
We'll come back again
And again, and again, and again, and again


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
We met up at my place 'cause my folks were out of town
It was our last night together, we were gonna make it count
We were headed off to Auburn, Texas Tech, and Kansas State
Like a band of brothers breakin' up with one more show to play

[Chorus]
So we drink a case of Shiner, and all my daddy's Maker's Mark
Pulled them speakers on the back porch, sat around and smoked cigars
We sang along and laughed 'til dawn and watched that red sunrise
That was a damn good goodbye

[Verse 2]
I was hurtin' that next mornin', but I had one thing left to do
'Cause the only girl I'd ever loved was bound for Baton Rouge
We said we'd make it work, but we both knew that was a lie
High school love ain't strong enough for a seven hour drive

[Chorus 2]
So we parked out by the football field, where we knew we'd be alone
Leaned them bucket seats way back, and made love all night long
Jumped the fence, sat in the stands and watched that red sunrise
That was a damn good goodbye

[Verse 3]
They ain't ever easy, sometimes they go bad
Oh but sometimes they turn into the best times you ever had
Nothing makes a memory that you'll take with you all your life
Like a damn good goodbye


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
My daddy always told me to be aware of my surroundings
Yeah, I got eyes all over this town
Yeah, you got caught kissing another guitar-picking bro
Says you're the one he's singing about

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hey, I still believe in love
But not the kind you're making with every guy in this pub
No one to blame but myself
I should've known you were with someone else
When I watched you give that "just a friend" a hug

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
No, I don't deal with bitches no more
No, no, no bitches (I ain't got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more, yeah

[Bridge]
I hope that it was worth it
Your reputation, you earned it
You're the best damn deal in town, oh, so cheap
Now I love this peace and quiet
No lying, cheating, fighting
Just me, myself, and these guitar strings

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
I could call you crazy, curse your name (I could call you crazy)
Throw your shit out the door (Throw your shit out the door)
But I don't deal with bitches no more (No, no bitches no more)
No, I won't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
No, I don't deal with bitches anymore
I just don't

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no bitches (Got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more
I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
No, no, no bitches (I could call you crazy)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (Don't you say nothin' more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (No, I don't deal with bitches)
No, no, no bitches
No, no, no bitches

[Verse 1]
He’s got old time religion
Buries his cash in a coffee can
And he makes his decisions
Down on his knees yeah he’s a full grown man
And he had a vision
Of a fire it burned up all of the land
You could call it superstition
You could run just as fast as you can
He took a beating
His father screamed at the top of his lungs
An Old Testament reading
If you spare the rod you spoil the son
He’s got scars for his bleeding
Fear of God fills everyone
You can listen to Him pleading
Pleadings for the holy son (to)

Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It’s good enough for me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
He’s got a King James edition
With all of the words of Christ in red
And he reads the inscription
Every night when he goes to bed
And he goes fishing
For sinnin' men like Jesus said
Got an old time conviction
Keeps the bodies in the shed
He had a woman
Took her to church every Sunday morn
He said submit to your husband
Submit to me thus, sayeth the Lord
Well he never saw it coming
When she tried to get away in his ‘34 Ford
Now a widower is strumming on a banjo with a missing cord

[Chorus]
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It’s good enough for me

Smoke was coming off my jacket and you didn’t seem to mind

Now, heartbreak ain’t a competition, but I took it in a landslide
The skeletons I wanted to bury, you liked out in the light

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Verse 2]
I wonder how you treasure what anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure wouldn’t be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-callin’, you don’t even bat an eye
I don’t scare you, and I guess that’s why

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Bridge]
Smoke was coming off my jacket
And I left a long trail of ashes

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back
To Hell and back

Round and round, round we go
Where it stops? Nobody knows it
Side to side, baby, back and forth
God above and the devil below him
You got your reasons and I got my wants
Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

[Chorus]
Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Just too old to die young now
Still, the good lord might lay me down

[Verse 2]
Round and round, round we go
Where it stops? Nobody knows it
Side to side, baby, down in the hole
God above and the devil below him
You got your reasons and I got my wants
Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Yes, too old to die young now
Still, the good lord might lay me down

I've been working like a slave
Ain't got no money
Done spent it all on pills
Got a girl at home that I call baby
And she does not love me when I get stoned
The memories they just won't leave
The secrets I'm gonna take to the grave with me
I got bills that ain't paid and pain that don't heal
I don't know how much longer I can deal

Is something wrong baby
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you

Well my grandma thinks the devil runs me
And the cross on my neck says no hell no
I got the Holy Spirit
And Baptist bones
A couple rusty strings with some nasty tones
So please don't bring no evil around me
Sitting and lying through your crooked teeth
I gotta go now baby so write it down
And I'll read it when my time runs out

Is there something wrong baby
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you

To fuss and fight with you

Girl you know that I love you
And you know that I care
But babydoll this fussing and fightings for the birds

Is something wrong baby
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got the time

Is there something wrong baby
Tell me what you're thinking
If it's that damn bad then keep it to yourself
I got a long way to get to where I'm going
And I ain't got time
To fuss and fight with you

Don't want to fuss and fight

The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move

You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in the knees
You put me right where I’m supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away

'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight

Sit back and let me drink you in

[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
You knew that I was coming cause you heard my name
But you don't know my game, you never felt my pain
Can't read my brain but you read my lips
And got scared when you heard that I was coming with hits
Now don't even trip, be a man instead
Give thanks I'm alive when I should be dead
Uh! I'm in the red cause my mind's distortin'
People claimin' that they know me, but they only know a portion
I'm gonna move mountains and touch the sun
Don't get scared now, you knew this day would come
So hold your bids, all bets are closed
And fuck all you hoes
Cause it's been a long time comin'
But I finally broke like an egg yolk I ain't no joke
Like some uncut dope motherfucker, Kid Rock's to blame
Same game, same name, ain't a damn thing changed
No sell-out, I ain't no ho, fuck the radio I'm comin' from that R-O-M-E-O
Watch me throw like a fist of rage
Self-made and paid and sawed-off 12 gauges
Up that ass for the 9-8
Never fake, shake, straight from the Great Lakes
Seven years on wax comin' correct
Flat out you diss me punk, that's when I pull the strap out
And I get to buck-buck-bucking I'm fuck-fuck-fucking your hoes
Cause they know who's runnin' this shit, Top Dog I'm the C-E-O
Role model, your mother-fucking H-E-R-O
My motto, "Be Cool - Keep Pimpin'."
Don't sleep, we roll deep in a Lincoln
Four Vogues on a hundred spokes
We bust Biltmore Beavers in Top Dog coats
We float like butterflies, sting like queen bees
Strapped with A-K's straight from the Chinese
What the fuck's goin' on in the D
Bunch of white boys pimpin' like the K-I-D
And it's all good I got love for my honkeys
We roll thick kick ass like donkeys
Anybody fuck's with you, I'm gonna mack 'em

[Chorus: Kid Rock]

Yeah we come to party, so get down everybody
Yeah we come to party

[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
I went from St. Claire shores and drink specials at Winners
To New York City and $700 dinners
From hangin' with sinners and second hand cheap sex
To gettin' much respect from top record execs
The cool Kid's claimin' up to call you out
So shut up now or put my balls in your mouth
Bet that ass hoss I ain't forgot
When I was tossed in the dime bin and left to rot
Used to call me funny when my nose was fucking runny
Now my fuckin' bunnies gettin' fuckin' Matchbox 20 money
Motherfuckers want to claim they're down
But when I was broke and down I never seen them around
All the shit we talked, all the shit we dreamed
I did it without you got a brand new team
No triple beams it seems like a movie
Bought two cribs, droptop, and jacuzzi
No more fluzzies only high class hoes
A couple when it rains and a few when it snows
A brand new nose to go along with my habit
And a garden hose made out of 24 karat
Bought a couple parots that like to squak
And they sound like you and all the shit you talk
Step inside my shoes, you couldn't fill em' doc
You're too old to kid, too soft to rock
Already did what most love to shout
7 years on wax and I still ain't sold out
And there ain't no doubt in my mind
That I'm gonna stomp all over you test of time

We're going platinum

And rake through kind like a bum through wine
It's my time so I'm gonna shine like glass
Old as piss, but small as ass
Watch me cash smoke some hash
You're raking grass while I'm raking cash
High-ass voice just like Aaron Neville
And I'm down with The Devil
Say we like to party, rock the party
We like to party, rock the party

Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over

We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)

Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in (Take it in)
This is a moment we won't forget (Won't forget)
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it

I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)

[Verse 2]
My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black
(I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone)
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you, and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday

[Chorus]
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?

The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people out of the ocean
We have the feeling like we were floating
We never noticed where time was going

Do you remember when we first got here
The days were longer, the nights were hot here
Now, it's September; the engine's starting
You're empty-handed and heavy-hearted

[Chorus]
But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line

[Verse 2]
You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all

It don't come often, and it don't stay long

[Outro]
But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no one

Chopping on that 808, ride by your house and make the window shake and the beat so hard, make the tempo break
And the next door neighbor wanna relocate - uh

Weed smoke and whiskey like a tornado whip
The south is in it, deep in it with bump
Be funky, the tree trunk gon' speed bump
Another round and the cops might have to hold me down
If you don’t know me you’ll know me after I hit the ground
Rittz filling my cup up until I get the ground
Pack this bitch to the ceiling and kill 'em and Billy now

She said, I was seven and you were nine

In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see

And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my

Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my

You know that you'd be perfect, you'd be perfect
If you just tried harder like I know you could then
You know that it'd be worth it, it'd be worth it

I could tell myself that you'll get there, you'll get there
But the more that you don't, the less blind I am
I could tell myself that you'll get there, hang in there
But honestly now, I'm beginning to understand

That I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
I'm in love with your potential

You act like I'm so perfect, I'm so perfect
A shot of stronger keeps me longer
And I hope that, I hope it's worth it, I hope it's worth it

She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

[VERSE 1]
We met by the river in the mid-morning light
She swears it was late afternoon
Well she fell in love by the time it was night
But I didn't give in 'till June
Well not long after we said I do she had the nerve to move in
She painted the walls she penned up my dog and
She kicked out all of my friends

She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

She burns through money like I burn through smokes
But she says that I need to quit
'Cause if I die from cancer in 25 years
She'll have to pay off the debt
No she don't think I'm funny she don't laugh at my jokes
I could care less about all her shoes
My parents both hate her but it evens out
Cause her parents both hate me too

[Chorus]
She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

She brings me coffee when I'm working late
She lifts me up when I'm low
She understands that I'm carrying weight
That I just have to hold up alone
She's determined and honest she's stubborn and strong
And I always know where she stands
So it never bugs me when she's always wrong
As long as she's wrong with her hand in my hand

She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison "never," shoot goodbye
Beat "regret" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound "fear" to a pile of sand
Choke "lonely" out with my bare hands
I'd hang "hate" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 2]
I'd take "brokeness" out back
And break "heartbreak," stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put "upset" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of "disgrace"
Lay "over" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 3]
I'd knock out "temptation"'s teeth
I'd sever "evil," let it bleed
Then light up "wicked," stand and watch it burn
I'd take "vice" and I'd take "vile"
Tie 'em up there with "hostile"
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
So give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word

Now when I was a young man I carried me pack, and I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback, well, I waltzed my Matilda all over

Then in 1915, my country said son, it's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done

So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun, and they marched me away to the war



And the band played Waltzing Matilda, as the ship pulled away from the Quay

And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears, we sailed off for Gallipoli



And how well I remember that terrible day, how our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay, we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter

Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well, he showered us with bullets
And he rained us with shell, and in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all straight to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia



But the band played Waltzing Matilda, when we stopped to bury our slain
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, then we started all over again



And those that were left, well we tried to survive, in that mad world of blood, death and fire

And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive, though around me the corpses piled higher

Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head, and when I woke up in my hospital bed
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead: never knew there was worse things than dyin'



For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda, all around the green bush far and free
To hang tent and pegs, a man needs both legs-no more waltzing Matilda for me



So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed, and they shipped us back home to Australia
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane, those proud wounded heroes of Suvla

And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay, I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me, to grieve, to mourn, and to pity



But the band played Waltzing Matilda, as they carried us down the gangway
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, then they turned all their faces away



And so now every April, I sit on me porch, and I watch the parades pass before me
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march, reviving old dreams of past glories

And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore, the forgotten heroes of a forgotten war

And the young people ask, what are they marching for? ...and I ask myself the same question



But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, and the old men still answer the call
But as year follows year, more old men disappear, someday no one will march there at all



"Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

I was sittin` in The Thirsty Devil, one sheet hung to the wind
When the bat wings doors creaked open and a stranger sauntered in
He moved his head from side to side and glared with a sunken eye
I heard the spin of a rusty spur as he shook off the dreary night

He lowered his hat, checked his gun and headed toward the bar
Walked on up beside me, I knew he'd traveled far
In a voice as thick as mud he looked to the 'keep and said…
"one shot of whiskey for myself and one for my new friend"

The patrons whispered hushed and low, they seemed to be afraid
As if a ghost had stood right up and walked out of its grave
His face was shallow and dirty, his skin like leather hide
Sure he spoke like any man, but something wasn't right

So I twisted on my stool, turned to him and said
"thank you sir, but just the same, I'm chasin` worms instead"
He growled and shoved the drink my way, his eyes cold as death
"I pick the drinks, you knock 'em back, else draw against my hand"

[Chorus]
When it's six to midnight and the boney hand of death is nigh
You better drink your drink and shut your mouth
If you draw against his hand, you can never win
Go ahead… drink with the living dead

"who the hell do you think you are?" my patience growin` thin
But swallow hard, I had to do, when the story he began
His lips curled back and words came forth starting up the tale
And every face inside that bar turned a shade of pale

"my name is Stanton Cree and I died three years before
I shot a man to steal his drink, at least that's what they hung me for
Now I'm cursed to walk the earth and challenge every night
A man to match me drink for drink or by the bullet die"

[Chorus]
When it's six to midnight and the boney hand of death is nigh
You better drink your drink and shut your mouth
If you draw against his hand, you can never win
Go ahead… drink with the living dead


"Now wait a minute, mister, no one makes me a fool"
I pushed the shot of whiskey back on over towards the ghoul
"I love a drink like any man but that's a losin` game
To drink or draw against the dead would only be insane"

Stanton Cree tipped his hat and laughed a wicked laugh
"you see, the lord cursed my soul for killin` that poor man
There ain't no choice so you must try to match me shot for shot
If you win, then you'll go free and I can finally rot"

[Chorus]
When it's six to midnight and the boney hand of death is nigh
You better drink your drink and shut your mouth
If you draw against his hand, you can never win
Go ahead… drink with the living dead

[Solo]

The barhop nodded slowly and I knew that I was screwed
If I chose to duel the dead then I would surely lose
So I took the glass and threw the shot into my throat
I would match him drink for drink, no matter if I choked

[Bridge - Spoken]
Whiskey, tequila, vodka, rum or gin
Ain't no man that I can't beat, be him live or dead
So into the morning I matched him ounce for ounce
Til Stanton Cree fell over and a winner was announced

Now he rests in his pine box and I still walk the streets
But I don't forget the night when death had chosen me
There ain't no fancy moral to go with this I fear
Unless you aim to kill a man and drink down his last beer!

[Chorus]
When it's six to midnight and the boney hand of death is nigh
You better drink your drink and shut your mouth
If you draw against his hand, you can never win
Go ahead… drink with the living dead

[Chorus]
Go ahead ... drink with the living dead
Go ahead ! drink with the living dead !

Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light
But he's my mistake to make all night (night, night, night)

This bar is full of locals, tourists, drunks and we're all hopeful
Praying that tonight we will be better than the rest
Most of us think we are movie stars
Give us a shot the world is ours
Come on baby, I think that you and I should dance

Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights

Telling stories about the younger you
Framed by the names etched in the booth
Letting my shoulder lean on yours in this cloud of cigarette smoke
I lose track of time on purpose
Tomorrow's gonna be long, but it's worth it
Feel the spins of alcohol and freedom
He just might and we still could
I'm debating if I should

Just another heartache in waiting
Just another sweet talking dream that ends in lonely nights
Just another handsome breakup
And he'll be gone before the morning light

This bar is shutting down
I don't mind if you walk me out
Oh, that's kinda what life's about

You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man

I done talked to the devil when he calls my name
But sometimes when I'm losing it all seems the same
And when I fall I'm back up again
Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Yeah they say

Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man

Try to keep my faith and keep my mind
Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind
And I can't help but mourning just a little each night
People say everything is gonna be alright
They say I'm the luckiest man
Yeah they say

That running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against

It can be a cold winter sunday
The kind where you can't get out of bed
You were my El Paso south wind
The sun that paints my desert red
You're an amen on a Carolina sand dune
A prayer that washes up on my shore
The blue sky that cuts through the black night
When I can't feel anymore

[Chorus]
You wrap me up in some kind of magic
Lift me up, take me so high
Finally something good for me happened
Such a rush, can't get enough of your love
Show me every color I can imagine
When its november and my soul is dark
You are my june
June in my Johnny Cash heart

Everybody's got an addiction
A real good feel good they need
Some trains, they don't hear you coming
'Til they are baring down on you
And your demons got you on your knees

My life is ill son... prepared to kill son
A paradox of pain, baby; it's real son
Lonely traveler, ain't trying to battle ya
But if you're feeling tuff dog, I welcome all challengers
Ain't got no family, you see there's one of me
Might lose your pulse standing two feet in front of me
I'm pissed at the world, but I ain't looking for trouble
I might crack a grin, I ain't looking to hug you
Think about it, nobody wants to die
There's rules to this game son, I'm justified
I'm ready to go partner, hey I'm on the run
The devils hugging on my boots that's why I own a gun
This journey's too long, I'm looking for some answers
So much time stressing, I forget the questions
I fear no man, you don't want no problems 'B'
Eyes in the back of my head, you better not follow me

You probably think I'm crazy, or got some loose screws
But that's alright though--I'm a'do me, you do you
So how you judging me? I'm just trying to survive
And if the time comes, I ain't trying to die
I'm just trying to fly, and get a little love
Find me a dime piece and get a little hug
Hook the car up--hit the bar up--clean the scars up--hey yo, the stars up
Hey this is the life of an outlaw
We ain't promised tomorrow--I'm living now, dog
I'm walking through life. but yo my feet hurt
All my blessings are fed, man I'll rest when I'm dead
Look through my eyes and see the real world
Take a walk with me, have a talk with me
Where we end up--God only knows
Strap your boots on tight you might be alright

I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am

You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you

I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say I love you to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains
I'm not gonna miss you
I'm not gonna miss you

[Verse 1]
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Verse 2]
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Bridge]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria

Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh

Songtekst van Danny Vera - "Roller Coaster"

[Verse 1]
Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy highs and real deep lows
I really don't know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
Cause I know you’re there with me

[Hook]
You don't have to slow me down
Cause I will always be around
I will find my way back home
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows

[Verse 2]
But I guess you know
Why I do, what I do and where I go
I try to fill an empty space inside
But I can't do that without you
You’re even with me in my dreams
I see a sail, the seven seas
I will try to find my way
You're always there tomorrow, you're always there tomorrow

[Chorus]
Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy heights and real deep lows
I really don't know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
Cause I know you there with me
You don't have to slow me down
Cause I will always be around
I will find my way back home
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows
Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy highs and real deep lows
I really don't know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
Cause I know you're there with me

[Post-Chorus]
Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
I can travel all the roads, you see
Cause I know you're there with me
Cause I know, oh I know
You’re there with me

[Verse 1]
The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Verse 2]
It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Bridge]
Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

On your love, (woke up still drunk on your love)

On your love, on your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk

[DAVID]
I hope this won't sound impolite
Or come across as too forthright
But, even though you seem alright, I...
Think I'm better than you!

Now please do keep this thought in mind
That's just my personal conviction
You're smart and fun
You're sweet and kind
I'd call our friendship an addiction

Your shoes are shined, your breath dulce
But still I find I have to say I
Think I might be better than you!

[DANIEL]
You seem impressed with what you've shown
But I don't find it that compelling
You've sung my praise, but not your own
And well, I think that's pretty telling

But while we're on the subject of
How I'm superb and leagues above
You
Ought to know I'm number one!

I know that might be hard to swallow
(La La La La!)
This hurts you just as much as me
(Oooh...)
But when this song is sung then you and I'll know
That you're just a nobody!

[DAVID]
Well, friend I don't know what to say

Try starting with your resignation

[Verse 1]
I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Bridge]
And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit country, she's a little bit of rock and roll
We was listenin' to 2 Chainz, singin' down an old dirt road
Makin' out on the porch swing, tan legs with the boots on
Said she wanna hear the boy sing, another country song

[Verse 1]
Every Friday night had me feelin' like Earnhardt
I was only seventeen, hit the road when it turned dark
First gear, second gear, third, let the tires bark
Wakin' up the neighbors with a Hank Williams Jr song
Pretty little lady waitin' on me, just a couple miles
To hell about a curfew, sixteen and buckwild
Flyin' down a back road, dodgin' cops and big deer
Waitin' on a kiss and a cold PBR beer
Livin' wild and free, no care about a consequence
Country love baby, yellow house, white picket fence
Pull up in the gravel, cut the lights in the driveway
Prayin' that her daddy don't come out with a gun raised
Seein' Daisy Dukes comin' toward me make my heart race
But son, when she got up in my truck, it was fast paced
Headed down the holler, lead foot like a Nascar
Gas tank full, windows down goin' to the bar

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit country, she's a little bit of rock and roll
We was listenin' to 2 Chainz, singin' down an old dirt road
Makin' out on the porch swing, tan legs with the boots on
Said she wanna hear the boy sing, another country song

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm Alice In Chains and a little bit of Nirvana
Sugar mama ridin' shawty, I'm diggin' the farmer's daughter
I roll in like Rusty Wallace, I'm dukin' from all the copper's
She diggin' this country boy like brandy in Joe's garden
She's my tin roof dancer on a full moon night
In the bed of my Chevy, underneath the cab light
She's my down home southern belle
Always with me raisin' hell
Strawberry Wine make a country girl drop a tail
Make me spin them damn wheels, wanna ditch the high heels
Wanna hit a trail up in the holler on a high hill
Ladies want a wild boy, ladies want a real man
Ladies want some grease up on them dirty greasy callused hands
Switchin' these gears like a truck I stole
Long legs on the dash, Ford flyin' down a back road
Sittin' right beside me, no damn seat belt on
Tearin' shit up, like a county line mud bog

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit country, she's a little bit of rock and roll
We was listenin' to 2 Chainz, singin' down an old dirt road

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end

The engine just gleams

Oh me oh my oh look at Miss Ohio
She’s a-running around with her ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"

Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the ragtop down
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now

Had your arm around her shoulder of a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you wanna do right, but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio?
She’s a-running around with the ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"

I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now

'Cause we ain’t gonna change round here
It’s a way of life

[Verse 1: Kalan Miller]
Hitting them back roads ridin' around with my kin folk
Can’t much change we stayed the same
Them country boys gon' maintain
We run dogs, outlaws, spot light, gig frogs
Out here these mud bogs
Sitting high on them white walls
We jacked up in our pick ups
Got a dime holdin' my spit cup
She like it when I hit four low
Slingin' rooster tails to the tree top
Look at her say "Let's roll"
She looked at me and say "Hell yeah"
Certified country girl you know we gon' raise hell
And we out here still gettin' it
Backwoods still livin' it
Working hard for what we got
Cash flow, still spendin' it
Yeah, my boys turn up for there
Turn down for what
Hop in the Chevy crank it up
Hit a back road we

[Verse 2: Rooster & Uncle Snap]
Me and that ol' back road keep swervin' around these tall pines
Find a spot, pop a top, and take a sip of that apple pie
I just love the slow pace of livin' down south
Hope I die of old age and buried right here at the house
Buddy my bloodline my last name ain’t shit changed about me
With that shotgun ain’t got to aim keep drankin' 'til I can’t see
Livin' way back in the sticks, nah I’m good right where I'm at
Y'all city folk keep rolling on, hey y'all ain’t got to come back
Yeah I’m country as a blue tick, boy I thought I told y'all
Ain’t ridin' with no new chick, I’m rollin' with my road dog
Way on past the railroad tracks, there’s a road up in the back
It winds around away from town, then dwindles down to a two path
Ridin' around them flat woods, sippin' on that act good
We jack 'em up and jack em out, ride 'em out like a Lac should
All my life I been broke, like white trash it’s a big joke
Grew up countin' them fence posts and takin' care of our kinfolk

Flingin' up mud through the country side
Tearin' up jars of that apple pie
Ain’t a damn thing changed we stayin' the same

Kickin' up dust just me and my crew
Keg full of beer with nothin' to do
Sittin' back watching time fly
It’s a country boy way of life

On a roll or off the tracks

Cleaning out the darkest corners of my mind
Taking all my full circles, and making straight lines
Been getting to the bottom of the bottom getting to me
Holding up the mirror to everything I don't want to see
But it ain't all flowers
Sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns

Been dancing with demons all my life
Every time I find my groove they cut in like a knife
Been a sin eater since the day I was born
Tired of feeling weighed down from carrying round all the pain that keeps me torn
So I pray when I lay me down to die
Grab a glass of wine and a seat to dine and go ahead and eat the whole damn pie

But it ain't all flowers
Sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get
The horns

Left a hole in her heart and it still ain't done

Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

[Verse 2]
Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you  outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

[Chorus]
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do

[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were "do not disturb"
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more

Ridin' roads

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
Thirty early out there in your drive
Got you a Bullet and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ridin' roads

[Verse 2]
Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round

Only thing that I want is your kiss

Ridin' roads

I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sunri-ri-rise

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus: Keith Whitley]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2: Keith Whitley]
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

[Chorus: Keith Whitley]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

The Father has a plan. Though it's hard to see it now
You f eel you're walking all alone. But He is there no doubt
When the storm around you rages, And you're tossed to and fro
When you're f aced with life's decisions, Not sure which way to go

Stand still and let God move
Standing still is hard to do
When you f eel you have reached the end
He'll make a way for you
Stand still and let God move

When the enemy surrounds you, And the walls are closing in
When the tide is swiftly rising, And you wonder where He's been
Friend, there never was a moment, That His arms weren't reaching out
You can rest assured and be secure, God is moving right now

When you feel you have reached the end, He'll make a way for you
Stand still and let God move
The answer will come, But only in His time

Stand still and let God move, Stand still and let God move

[Verse 1]
I killed my first monster when I was seven years old
He melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb
Kept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer
Under my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 2]
The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, and make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 3]
Daddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light
I smile and say, "All clear" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?
I kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
And I've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed

Big stars breakin' out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin' in in stereo
Tail lights disappear in 'bout a mile or so

Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
'Bout to lift it off, I'm 'bout to twist it off

Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm a million lightyears away from the dark
A thousand miles and running
Country boy can survive
I'm alive, a loaded gunnin'
Backseat full of crooks
Pen and paper, this one's for the books
Pack it, wrap it, seal it, send it
To the corner in a Travis Caddy
Everybody in this motherfucker jumpin', footprints on the wall
Gimme the losers, the ones who don't fit in
And with this shit we're gonna have a ball
Swing around the mosh pit, do-si-do
Catfish Billy and a Dobro
I'm Psycho White – oh, no
I'm a chili pepper in an Oldsmobile
Comin' out for the kill
I don't gamble
I don't deal with these whose whose in this mass appeal
I just wanna be behind a steering wheel of a semi-truck
Then get drunk and run amuck
With every single one of my misfits
Bitch, that's how we're showin' up
With them lowriders on the west side
Lift kits from the south
Jump in the passenger seat of my '69 and hit the bootleg house
I'm on my new shit, still ready and ruthless
A public nuisance
But I feel right at home

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Since they're still sleepin' on me, let me wake 'em up
Got the world in my palm, watch me shake it up
Everything I'm talkin' real, I ain't make it up
I know you probably think I care, but I don't give a fuck
But I ain't givin' up, I'd rather live it up
Everybody sound the same, you need to switch it up
They still swervin' in my lane, they need to give it up
But I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, really I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Still bumpin' Three 6 all day, Hank Williams all day
So promenade when the lights in the ballroom swing
And shake and then fall and break with that bottom bass
Make you wanna tear the club up and go tattoo your face
Country boys, gutter raised, what a blend, that's all it takes
Got a lock in the pocket, a rock in the sock
With a cop I'm a nervous wreck
I never could keep a job 'cause I rob and I take
And I leave you with nothing left
But mama tried
Mama tried to harvest early and the pot died
If she ever said I was a good boy, trust me, mama lied
Leave these haters with a cane to walk
Take these lames with a grain of salt
All I wanna do is take aim, assault, tell my story
Paint the wall from Alabama to Atlanta
From Atlanta I began to build a plan, a panoramic view
To center who my friends, the men around me was
The culture is that slum, and I'm not alone
I put a flag in Nashville, and I'm feelin' right at home

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Since they're still sleepin' on me, let me wake 'em up
Got the world in my palm, watch me shake it up
Everything I'm talkin' real, I ain't make it up
I know you probably think I care, but I don't give a fuck
But I ain't givin' up, I'd rather live it up
Everybody sound the same, you need to switch it up
They still swervin' in my lane, they need to give it up
But I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, really I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
And the whole world is yours
This I know, because Nas told me so
Damn right, so give me that bag of money real quick
Let's go, I've got it cranked, it's parked out front
I'm a wanted man and I'm on the run
And I'm goin' back to Cali to the alleys where they packin' rallies
With the skateboarders, punks and rowdies
And show 'em this country savvy
I, am, Yelawolf and I'm feelin' right at home

Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?”
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around

Hey, we're all in the same boat
Life can really suck sometimes
But hey, can't live in a shadow
So here's a little piece of advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio

[Chorus]
That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Hey, world's kinda messed up
We got no time for sittin' around
Waitin' for it to lit up
Let's break some rules and figure it out

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew

I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

[Verse 3]
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

[Verse 4]
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

[Verse 1]
Well, I’ve been living like a wild ol’ mustang
Out in Montana fields
Might’a earned me a bad reputation
But never stopped these wheels
From going and rolling too far
Running and gunning a little too hard
So un-reigned, so untamed, yeah

[Chorus]
So God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you

[Verse 2]
Your soul is pure golden
Must’ve been true love you were grown in
Sent the sun rays to a dark place
On the same day, yeah, God made

[Chorus]
God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land
And raise a few
More girls like you
More girls like you

[Bridge]
It’s been a while since I stopped and prayed
But Lord have mercy look at her
He sure didn’t make no mistake when he put that angel on Earth
Yeah, God made …

[Chorus]
God made girls like you make guys like me
Wanna reach for the brightest star, set it on a ring
Put it on your hand, grab a piece of land

I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby, what's your status?
And tell me are you tryna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:

[Chorus]
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand

When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
Cause boy, I've gotta mark it

And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing

Well, it’s all going to pot
Whether we like it or not
Best  I can tell
The world’s gone to hell
And we’re sure gonna miss it a lot

All of the whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Just couldn't hit the spot
I gotta hundred dollar bill, friend
You can keep your pills
Cause it’s all going to pot

That cackle-bobble-head-in-a-box
Must think I'm dumb as a rock

While I'm kickin' off my shoes
And it's scarin' me outta my socks

Sweetest little thing in the world

With her eye on your money
Is gonna take every penny you got
I said she's never gonna get it
Cause I've already spent it

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind
You're tethered to another and you're worried all the time
You always knew the melody but you never heard it rhyme
She's fair and she is quiet, Lord, she doesn't look like me
She made me love the morning, she's a holiday at sea
The New York streets are as busy as they always used to be
But I am the mother of Evangeline

[Verse 2]
The first things that she took from me were selfishness and sleep
She broke a thousand heirlooms I was never meant to keep
She filled my life with color, canceled plans, and trashed my car
But none of that was ever who we are
Outside of my windows are the mountains and the snow
I hold you while you're sleeping and I wish that I could go
All my rowdy friends are out accomplishing their dreams
But I am the mother of Evangeline

[Bridge]
And they've still got their morning paper and their coffee and their time
And they still enjoy their evenings with the skeptics and the wine
Oh, but all the wonders I have seen, I will see a second time
From inside of the ages through your eyes

[Verse 3]
You are not an accident where no one thought it through
The world has stood against us, made us mean to fight for you
And when we chose your name we knew that you'd fight the power too
You're nothing short of magical and beautiful to me
Oh, I'll never hit the big time without you
So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline

They can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine
'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playin'
They sure put those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Bridge]
And you were like (oh woah oh)
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

[Chorus]
Cause there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
But you were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart

[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, "You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me"

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, "Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?"

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, "no that's not me"
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son

Now I've freezing hands
And bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I wish I was the moon tonight

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt
I had forgotten my name
Cause I had sold my soul
But awoke just the same
I'm so lonely
I wish I was the moon tonight

[Verse 2]
God blessed me, I'm a free man
With no place free to go
I'm paralyzed and collared-tight
No pills for what I fear

Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go

There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the dogies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Now, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike
On account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go whoa

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So, goodnight all you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

These sleepin' pills ain't workin' for me
I'm wide awake talkin' to these naked walls
They ain't got to much to say, and i get tired
And my mind goes out the gutter
Past and present run together, kinda like they used to

And i can't believe your not alone
Happy as hell and done moved on
Heard he's a banker down in Austin
I thought you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe

It's 4 a.m
You never answer this late
If you do it's unexpected
If you do it turns out great
But only for a little while
Until you realize what you've done
Until you see that mornin' sun
You always tuck your tail and you start to run

I can't believe your not alone
Happy as hell and done moved on
And i can't believe you're south of Austin
When you told me that you hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe

And i can't believe that your not at home
Happy as hell and done moved on
I can't believe your leavin' Austin
I know you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

[Verse]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

[Verse]
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of the simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high

The Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high (high  high)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)

Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you--does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue

Took my first breath, where the muddy Brazos
Spills into the Gulf of Mexico
Where the skyline’s colored by chemical plants
T’put bread on the table of the working man
Where the working man does his best to provide
Safety and shelter for kids and a wife
Given little of his soul every day
Making over time to keep the wolves away

[Verse 2]
Well I was barely thirteen when the company man
Tried to dig my dad his grave
It happened on a French owned tanker ship
Spillin' poison in the Galveston Bay
Where the liquid fire filled his lungs and his eyes
Silenced any mortal cries
Cold and the grip of death stinging pain
He fought like hell to keep the wolves away

[Verse 3]
For the next few years dad was sick as a dog
But he made a recovery just to spite the odds
The settlement came and we moved out of town
Where the sky isn’t heavy with refinery clouds
Yeah he’s still alive he’s doing good he’s in his fifties
But the moneys running out, 'n he’s pinching for pennies
So goin’ for broke with every song I’ve made
'Cause now it’s my turn to keep the wolves away

Makin' me think like you're mine

Now it's like you don't remember my name
Let me in, where you've been?
What we gonna be this time?

Just for tonight, just for tonight
Forget who we are, give up and ignite
Go with me through the dark

What you mean when you say you're better now?
All these clothes like you still want me around
I can't give you this for nothing, help me out

Go with me through the dark

Make me believe that you need me most
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost

You told me no matter, everywhere we go
I was your rock, was it just a joke?
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Call me right back, call me right back
Make me believe that you need me most
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost

[Outro]
You told me no matter, everywhere we go
I was your rock, was it just a joke?
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Call me right back, just for tonight
Call me right back, just for tonight
Be the real thing, don't be just a ghost
Why can I call but I can't get hope?
Call me right back, call me right back

[Verse 1]
There's trouble where I'm going
But I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings
Cause they always seem to start this way
I'm looking for a lighter
I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit
On my way out of Lafayette
Eastbound and Down
I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel
My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel
I'm going north on 59 but I know good and well
I'm headed south
'Cause me and Birmingham
Don't have a history of working out

[Chorus 1]
What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

[Verse 2]
I ain't unpacked my suitcase
Since the day that I turned twenty one
It's been a long ten years since then
It's getting kinda cumbersome
The first one and the last one
And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing

[Chorus 2]
What I lost in Lubbock, Texas
I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

[Outro]
I carry them around with me
I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison
But there's freedom in a broken heart

Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar

[Vers 1]
Det är en stilla kväll men jag får ingen ro
Solen dröjer kvar vid havets rand
Jag börjar tänka på, en gång för länge sen
En annan kväll i pilevallars land

[Brygga]
Spelemännen spelade som elden vore lös
Pågarna från Sjöbo var vilda och de svingade varsin tös

[Refräng]
Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar

[Vers 2]
Under eken där vid ån frågade du mig
Om jag var din i alla våra dar
Och solen sänkte sig när fiolen stämde upp
Jag lovade att alltid stanna kvar

[Refräng]
Det var dans och hålligång uppå logen natten lång
Det var sommar, det var guld och gröna skogar
Jag var ung och du var grann, som vi älskade varann
Och jag lovade dig guld och gröna skogar, ja!

She's caviar and mascara
I'm corduroy and leather
It'd take one hell of an imagination
To ever paint us together

[Verse 2]
Places I like to haunt at
She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head

[Chorus]
But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll

[Verse 3]
Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires

I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

Ain't no map, ain't no way
Ain't no lights on this long highway
But I know the way by heart
Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry

Baby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go

And only you could know the pain
You weren't afraid to face the devil
You were no stranger to the rain

So go rest high on that mountain
Son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son

Oh, how we cried the day you left us
We gathered round your grave to grieve
Wish I could see the angels faces
When they hear your sweet voice sing

So go rest high on that mountain
Son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'

Strawberry wine on your lips got me amazed
How 'bout you let this cowboy take you away?
Gimme that wink, I'ma give it right back
You know you like it, you love it, you want some more of that

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me smile like I did when we were radio kids
Catching that countdown on Sunday, all the way to one day

[Chorus]
Whenever
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
Got me spinning like a jukebox junkie
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you

[Verse 2]
You see that water tower? Girl, we can dream on it
I'ma paint your name in John Deere green on it
I, I cross my heart, I ain't no walk-away Joe
I'm gonna get you to the church on Cumberland Road

[Pre-Chorus]
And you get sweeter with time
Just like that bottle of wine
Might be a little dust on it but
Won't it taste so fine? (Just like you)

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I'm sold to the lady in the front seat
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
You make me feel like 90's country

[Bridge]
You know you're beautiful, don't act like you don't
Ain't settling for no burger and no grape snow cone, not tonight

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I ain't in it for your daddy's money
You make me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
Baby, don't be stupid, you know I love you
Blame it all on my roots when I turned up at 90's country

I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?

Situation gets rough, then I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
Hey, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it

[Chorus]
You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time!

I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?

I take 1, 1, 1 'cause you left me
And 2, 2, 2 for my family
And 3, 3, 3 for my heartache
And 4, 4, 4 for my headaches
And 5, 5, 5 for my lonely
And 6, 6, 6 for my sorrow
And 7, 7 n-n-n-n-no tomorrow
And 8, 8, I forget what 8 was for
But 9, 9, 9 for a lost god
And 10, 10, 10, 10 for everything, everything, everything, everything!

Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (do it all the time!)
Do it all the time (do it all the time!)

[Verse 1]
The new year's getting older, the February roses are withered away
The sun keeps getting closer, sinking a little slower everyday
Ooh, it's getting louder at the lights, music clashing in the street
Moon shining on the parking lot dolls
Tanned legs in the nights, sliding out of the seat
Stilettos at the crosswalk

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I graduated, but every year in May, I get that school's out feeling
I feel it creeping in
Every day's a weekend and I'm drowning in the freedom

[Chorus]
Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I loved her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

[Verse 2]
I've gone off the deep end, company I'm keeping is messing me up
The good girls at home sleeping while I'm out creeping 'til the sun comes up
Ooh, I’ve got my phone faced down and my hair combed back, riding round, getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls, holding hands and forgetting their names

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I graduated, but every year in May, I get that school's out feeling
Don't wanna leave here, but damn it, I'm not a cheater and I can't help leaving

[Chorus]
Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

[Bridge]
All of these pretty young things (pretty young things)
Can make you forget a goodbye's sad
Try to make a good guy bad

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I love her

I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

Why do I love all of these city girls?
Why do I love all of these city girls?
Why do I love all of these city girls with pretty eyes?
Down on Demonbreun and broken hearted rich girls, the debutantes, the small town runaways
All dolled up at the bar, with debit cards, they don’t know how pretty they are
City girls, city girls

[Intro: Jelly Roll]
I can only tell the truth, yeah

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
First time that we locked eyes
Stomach felt like it had knots tied
I cannot lie, I wanted to try
But I knew right then it was not time
So I sat back and I played my position
And I prayed that you made your decision
And I know that I was an asshole
But I felt all along that you ain't really with it
Love the way that you talk to me
When you talk to me like my best friend
When you provide me with security
And a future that we can invest in
Hate the city, cost too much money
Askin' you to move out to the country
White picket fence with a nice little crib
Play this guitar, we can raise these kids
Ain't no sunset on this boulevard
So come and go, as you please
And forgive me 'cause I know it seems
That these roads here were paved of broken dream
Ain't not Las Vegas light
Ain't no California coke
And I done seen a lot of both
But this shit is in my soul, and so are you

[Chorus: Shooter Jennings]
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm ridin' with you baby, in it for the long run
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm livin' like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm ridin' with you baby, in it for the long run
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm livin' like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun

[Verse 2: Struggle Jennings]
Baby look at that big picture
No more skippin' through all them bad scenes
See nightmares only make it sweeter
When you livin' inside them wild dreams
Never living inside someone elses mean
We gone fly high even if we down
So stick around I'ma spend my life
Right by your side polishin' your crown
Stand up and adjust it, girl
I'm ridin' with you better trust it
Leave them haters disgusted
They can't catch up 'ca we mustard
And we suffered long enough in the gutter
We both deserve what we built here
We instill fear 'cause our fairytale
Is so real with no end near
Been here for over ten years
You're no stranger to the danger of my life
Gripped the banger like you hold my heart
Then squeeze tight, never let it slip
Big city lights, slow country pace
Leather and lace, outlaws and angels
We wove a web of love and trust
Stay wrapped up 'cause I'm so tangled

[Chorus: Shooter Jennings]
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm ridin' with you baby, in it for the long run
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm livin' like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm ridin' with you baby, in it for the long run
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm livin' like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun

Love won, I give you my gun
I'm ridin' with you baby, in it for the long run
Love won, I give you my gun
I'm livin' like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun
Love won, I give you my gun

You're an angel, you're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'

I was lost in the neon lights

And they say when you know you know
And I know one thing's for sure

It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, and I know we're crazy, yeah

Tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough
Maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love?

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

We used to sit up at the flats

Gettin' high and skippin' class

Yeah, I reckon we were heathens
But in her eyes we were saints
Now you're callin' all the boys home
'Cause heaven's angels carried her away

[Chorus]
So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

[Verse 3]
Back when all us boys were tryin'
To make sense of all these strings
I can see her in the corner
Singin' along to all our crazy dreams

AndI will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

'Cause that's what us boys are for
To help you out when you get weary
And you can't go no more

One sided
Everything about your love was one sided
Didn't cover it up or disguise it
You used my dream against me to tie me to you
Two years too many, we tried to get it right
Hit like a shot of tequila without the lime
You've got your reasons and, yeah, I got my rhymes
So this time, this time

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh
Better luck next time, hey

[Verse 2]
We tried it
But when two hearts don't light up, you can't fight it
And in every storm, there's still silver linin'
And with every day that passes, I find it, oh

I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh

Blame on mistakes, but we had to roll the dice
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, yeah
Better luck next time, oh

[Verse 1]
Ain't it just like a tear
To go and blur out everything
Ain't it just like glass
To fall and break so easily
Ain't it just like love
To leave a mark on the skin and underneath
Yeah, when the pain goes and shadows everything

[Chorus 1]
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
When it hurts too much to see
Keep your eyes on me

[Verse 2]
Ain't it the sinner
Who gets all the grace sometimes
Ain't it the saint
Who picks up the pieces left behind
Yeah, and it's human to hurt the one
You hurt the one you love the most
And you can't find the sun

[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

[Bridge]
You swear you're all alone sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
And you can't find your way home sometimes
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me

[Chorus 2]
Keep your eyes on me
When you're lost in the dark
Keep your eyes on me
When the light in your heart is
Too burned out to see
Keep your eyes on me

[Verse 1]
You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Verse 2]
Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

[Bridge]
Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

[Chorus]
When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time, oh
You did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time, yeah
You did something for the first time?

[Verse 1]
What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

[Verse 2]
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Verse 3]
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools

My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

Mine would be...you

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster

[Chorus]
Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you

[Verse 2]
There’s something in the bittersweet feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment, all I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying, when they played it

Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
He's a phone call to his parents
He's a bible by the bed
He's the t-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 2]
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him

He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time

And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 1]
You said goodbye with words cold as ice
I was shaking watching you go
I couldn’t breathe
No, I just couldn’t see past you leaving me here all alone
It’s funny what a little time does, baby

[Chorus]
I’m better than you left me
I’m better than I should be
I’m better than I was when you walked out that door
I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then
So don’t you think I’ll take you back like every time before
No, baby I don’t think you know me anymore
I’m better than you left me

[Verse 2]
Now, here you are trying to win back my heart
And I bet you thought it’d be easy to do
But baby I changed now you get a taste of standing on the side where you lose
Ain’t it funny what a little time does, baby

[Chorus]
I’m better than you left me
I’m better than I should be
I’m better than I was when you walked out that door
I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then
So don’t you think I’ll take you back like every time before
No, baby I don’t think you know me anymore
I’m better than you left me

Now I love deeper and I laugh a little bit louder
I smile brighter and I fly higher

Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Aah!

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

It just ain't right

Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why

Oh, how the breakers roar
Keep pulling me farther from shore
Thoughts turn to a love so kind
Just to keep me from losing my mind
So enticing, deep dark seas
It's so easy to drown in the dream

[Verse 2]
Oh, and everything is not what it seems
This life is but a dream
Shatter illusions that hold your spirit down
Open up your heart and you'll find love all around
Breathing and moving are healing
And soothing away
All the pain in life holding you down

[Verse 3]
Bone breaks and heals
Oh, but heartaches can kill
From the inside, so it seems
Oh, I'm telling you it's all a dream

Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood

Well I got caught in Panama City
Tryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls
And I got wore out by my daddy
For stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and More
And all my friends would get away
Seems I'd get caught, plain as day
I took the blame for every little thing

But I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you

[Verse 2]
Well lookin' like you do
On its damn own, should be a crime
Let alone a fool like me
Hand in hand with you, should be doin' time
But here we are runnin' free
Guess someone turned the other cheek
'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view

Guess I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth

The county jails and one phone calls
I'd do it all again if I had to

These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?

Like for instance

Next time it's 3 AM and you've got Tequila blues
You're wishin' I was him remember I'm glad she ain't you
These calls just waste my minutes don't even dial my digits
Me and you are finished, babe that bed you made keep sleepin' in it

What'd you really think I'd say if we talked come on now be honest
No wait, I almost forgot you ain't familiar with the process
If conversation's what you want well darlin' now you've got it
So before it's time for hanging up I'm making sure you got that

Next time it's 3 AM and you've got Tequila blues

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear

And they're coming after me

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams

Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (why)
Tell me why (why)

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know


Start of song 


Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day, like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die


Start of song 


Well, I get into the game, but it's always the same
I'm the man with the name, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, poor boy
Call me whatever you may, I ain't stoppin' the train
I got a pill for the pain, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, poor boy

And I know that I can't defeat you
But you don't worry now, I ain't goin' to preach to you
Well, there ya' go
But I'll be goin' right there with you
Yeah, wherever you'll be, you'll be lookin' at me

But don't get out of your chair
Put a bow in your hair, you might be makin' 'em stare
So leave the care to the poor boy, the poor boy
And that's the name of the game
Keep on stayin' the same, ain't nobody to blame
Nobody but the poor boy, the poor boy

Well okay, so you fell asleep today
What's funny to me though is that you did that yesterday
You might think I'm mad
Doin' all the things that I don't need to do
But while you're laughin' at me, well I'll be laughin' at you

So I get into the game, but always keep it the same
And I'll be usin' your name, but they'll be yellin' at me "Poor boy, poor boy"
But I'll be happy for you, 'cause you got nothin' to do
And I'll be singin' the blues, walkin' around singin' "Poor boy, poor boy"

Sometimes a cold shiver comes over me
And it turns me on when the song takes over me
But alright, I can't fight it the odds are against me
But I can't sit still
Because I know that I will

And you'll be watching me girl, takin' over the world
Let the stripes unfurl, gettin' rich singin' "Poor boy, poor boy"
And I'll be comin' to play, I do it every day
And the title will stay, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, poor boy (Yeah)


Start of song 


Well lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Well sex is cheap and the talk is overrated
And the boys and me are still working on the sound

A little happiness, a little love was all I wanted
Sure as Hell thought I'd found it but I was wrong
She left my heart feelin' taunted and my memories all haunted
But it's her I have to thank for all my songs

So every day I'm smokin' my brain hazy
All I can do to keep from goin' crazy
But the paranoia is slowly creepin' in
I keep drinkin' myself silly
Only way for this hillbilly
And I thank God for this here life of sin

Every morning when I rise look in the mirror and despise
The sight of everything and all that I've become
The level of my medicating some might find intimidating
But that's alright cause' it don't bother me none

Well lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Well sex is cheap and the talk is overrated
And the boys and me still workin' on the sound

[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living

[Verse 1]
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 2]
Bittersweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need

[Chorus]
But I will always love you
I will always love you

[Bridge]
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

[Intro]
From a dusty trail he came
All the way from the Aleutian Islands on an Alaskan Fishin' boat
To the rollin' hills of Kentucky
Through the backwoods of Missouri
To the snow cap rockies of Colorado
'Cross the hot swamps of Florida
To the Lakes of Tennessee
With a dog named Bandit by his side, he rides
He is the backwoods badass
Out.....Law
YELLLOOOOWWW

[Verse 1: Outlaw]
Keep it frikin' hillbilly this is what I say
In every single way I live it every single day
Judgin' from my looks, you'd say that I'm a hick
You think that I'd get mad but nah that's just my stick
Boots on camouflage, Copenhagen dip
Moonshine jar I think I might get me a sip
Redneck hillbilly country mothertrucker
Yuppies think it's funny that my cousin is my brother!
Born in a trailer in the middle of the woods
Shootin' Deer and drinkin' Beer it's all misunderstood
Dip in my lip, Mudjug in my hand
Redneck Nation on my back we dominate and fade to black
Gettin' drunk up in the back of a Burban truck I'm skinnin' bucks
Shootin' ducks runnin' 'em up not givin' a fuck
If y'all don't like that stuff, y'all can dick my suck

[Chorus: Outlaw]
Backwoods Badass, That is what they call me
O-U-T, L-A dub that is what they call me
King of the woods, hick from the sticks
That is what they call me
Outlaw, Outlaw, that is what they call me
O-U-T, That is what they call me
L-A dub that is what they call me
O-U-T, that is what they call me
OUTLAW, that is what they call me

[Verse 2: Fatt Tarr]
Back in the woods, gettin' me a dip
I see a big tree I might just take me a shit
We got 12 gauges on both of our shoulders
Redneck, Redneck, Redneck Souljers
Tiller Tiller Gang up in this thing as usual
That's my catchphrase I think that sumbitch is beautiful
Boots and suits I find it almost suitable
'Cause the men in black are back in the Cadillac y'all just rootie poo

[Verse 3: C-Hubb]
I'm in the backwoods feelin' like a badass
With a pretty country girl who's got a fat ass
A couple buddies, couple bottles and some crab grass
I mean that home grown will sit you on your ass flat
About a mile down the road from where my momma had me
Another mile from that is where my nanny raised my daddy
If you've never been down here we'll show you gladly
But if I take off on this 4x4 you better grab me

[Chorus: Outlaw]
Backwoods Badass, That is what they call me
O-U-T, L-A dub that is what they call me
King of the woods, Hick from the sticks
That is what they call me
Outlaw, Outlaw, that is what they call me
O-U-T, That is what they call me
L-A dub that is what they call me
O-U-T, that is what they call me
OUTLAW that is what they call me

Verse 1. Down here my burdens are heavy and the road seems rough and long
Sometimes my feet grow weary and so slow
There's a brighter day a coming, soon I'll step on heaven's shore
And I won't have to worry anymore
CHORUS:

No I won't have to worry when I reach the other shore
All my troubles will be over and I'll rest forevermore
My eyes will be on Jesus, and my heart will be aglow
And I won't have to worry anymore

Verse 2. Someday when life is over and I've said my last goodbyes
I'll see the Savior standing at the door
I'll hear him say, "You're welcome. All your cares you've left behind
And I won't have to worry anymore

[Verse 1]
Living's like a jigsaw
And the farther in you go
If you're missing pieces
Never really know
When you're ticking like a timepiece
On which you can rely
Wonder why you wind it
When you're running out of time

[Chorus]
Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

[Verse 2]
Living's supposed to kill you
But it shouldn't feel like dying
Loving's supposed to fill you
But it spills you like your wine
And all the paper people
Wandering about
Wondering who made them
And who's gonna cut them out

[Chorus]
Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

[Bridge]
And even in the morning
When the sun's behind the clouds
In the state you're born in
In the state that you're in now
Even if the roof is leaking
It's still above your head
Just remember two words that the two birds never said

[Chorus]
Sometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts
No one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart
Pick up all the pieces and go back to the start
Never losing, only using all your moving parts
All your moving parts

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

[Verse 2]
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

[Chorus: Taylor Ray Holbrook]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We kinda like 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

[Verse 1: Upchurch]
Grab a six-pack son, go hop in the back
Everybody 'round here know where the party's at
Down a real long road on private land
Passed down to me from my old man
Yeah, we get rowdy, crank it up too loud
Southern pride still makes me proud
Them long legs still drive me wild
When there's nowhere to go just drivin' 'round
Ain't nothin' like a sunset sittin' on down with a sun-kissed girl sittin' eyes on me
Take a picture for the moment so time will freeze
If you're lookin' for me, you'll know where I'll be
Beneath these hollars, hills, and trees
My kids gonna do that same 'ol thing
Same 'ol song, same guitar, just different strings

[Chorus: Taylor Ray Holbrook]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We kinda like 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

[Verse 2: Taylor Ray Holbrook]
You can take me out of the country, but you can't take it out of me
See these roots in my veins trying to do it different that any human eye can see (See)
How it was is how it is, ain't nothin' gonna change 'bout the way we live
I'm still runnin' around, that same old kid
Barefoot and all, just gained some years (Yup)
Let me tell you 'bout a backroad
Talk about the ones that we still ride on
In a little bitty town nothin' goin' around romance with the lights on
Back pew believer, I'm an underachiever
Just a good 'ol boy turned to a singer

[Chorus: Taylor Ray Holbrook & Upchurch]
All my rowdy country friends around here
We like to meet at the hollar, build a fire, drink a beer
We slip out to the field, climb a tree, shoot a deer
I reminiscence about these days, man I get a chill
We keep our trucks lifted up so high
We gotta lock 'em down into four-wheel drive
Sideways in a mud hole, that's just how it goes
'Round here, I'm talkin' 'bout the southern land

So why are you letting him hang around?
Girl, you gotta know when to clean house
And throw his shit out in the yard

If it was the first time, I would understand
But it's the third time - he got a second chance
There's a fine line between an accident
And an L-O-S-E-R

It's bullshit, you know it
Yeah, I see it in your eyes
Every time that you tell me
Deep down he's a really good guy

Drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your

You say he saw the light, the slate is clean

In every American community, you have varying shades of political opinion. One of the shadiest of these is the liberals. An outspoken group on many subjects. 10 degrees to the left of center in good times, 10 degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally. So here, then, is a lesson in safe logic

I cried when they shot Medgar Evers
Tears ran down my spine
And I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy
As though I'd lost a father of mine
But Malcolm X got what was coming
He got what he asked for this time
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal
Get it?

I go to civil rights rallies
And I put down the old D.A.R (D.A.R., that's the Dykes of the American Revolution)
I love Harry and Sidney and Sammy
I hope every colored boy becomes a star
But don't talk about revolution
That's going a little bit too far
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

I cheered when Humphrey was chosen
My faith in the system restored
I'm glad that the Commies were thrown out
Of the A.F.L. C.I.O. board
And I love Puerto Ricans and Negros
As long as they don't move next door
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

Ah, the people of old Mississippi
Should all hang their heads in shame
Now, I can't understand how their minds work
What's the matter don't they watch Les Crane?
But if you ask me to bus my children
I hope the cops take down your name
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

Yes, I read New Republic and Nation
I've learned to take every view
You know, I've memorized Lerner and Golden
I feel like I'm almost a Jew
But when it comes to times like Korea
There's no one more red, white and blue
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

I vote for the democratic party
They want the U.N. to be strong
I attend all the Pete Seeger concerts
He sure gets me singing those songs
And I'll send all the money you ask for
But don't ask me to come on along
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

Once I was young and impulsive
I wore every conceivable pin
Even went to the socialist meetings
Learned all the old Union hymns
But I've grown older and wiser
And that's why I'm turning you in
So love me, love me, love me, I'm a liberal

[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

[Pre Chorus 2]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Bridge]
I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say

[Chorus]
Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, thats what I do
When I pray for you
When I pray for you
When I pray for you

[Verse 1]
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Verse 2]
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know that I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Bridge]
Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall

'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you

East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

[Verse 1]
Keep your foot hard on the pedal
Son never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out, cause we've got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
And there's beer in Texarkana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done

Old Smokey's got them ears on
He's hot on your trail
And he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail
So you gotta dodge him, you gotta duck him
You've gotta keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell

[Verse 1]
Don't turn mailboxes into baseballs
Don't get busted selling at seventeen
Most thoughts deserve about two or three more
Motor oil is motor oil
Just keep the engine clean
Keep your eyes on the prize
Everything will be fine
Long as you stay in school
Stay off the hard stuff
And keep between the lines

[Verse 2]
Don't burn two lanterns at the same time
No ship out on the water will pay your rent
'Cause you live and you learn
Sometimes you get burned
When your get out done got up
Walked out the door and went
Do as I say
Don't do as I've done
It don't have to be
Like a father, like his son

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Don't let them try to upsell you
There's a reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
If there's any doubt, then there is no doubt
The gut don't never lie
And the only word you'll ever need to know in life is "why"
Keep your head out of the clouds
And remember to be kind
And just stay in school
Stay off the drugs
And keep between the lines

You don't wanna tell your friends
You don't wanna pack your stuff
Fall back in love with another girl again
All alone, picking up take out
Coming home to an empty house
Admittin' that the time we spent
Was just a lesson

[Chorus]
We've got all our reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
In case of what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why

[Verse 2]
We feel like roommates, standing at the same sink
We don't even kiss goodnight
I don't wanna be a quitter, don't wanna have to answer
When everybody asks me why
Giving all your t-shirts back
Putting all my stuff in bags
We were supposed to be married by the time 'bout the time we're 30
Breaking up is scary

[Chorus]
All these reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
In case of what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

It can be, it can be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it should be just that simple, baby (yeah)

Taco Bell is open late
Slumber parties, movie date
Saturday, I can't complain
Take me back to the good ol' days
Ohio and chasing baes
That's how they made Saturdays
In my Jeep, lots of doors
Pullin' up to Gucci stores
Start a fire, cook some s'mores
Found a date and close the door
Yeah, we're here, yeah, we're lit
Now it's 'Rari's, no civics
I ain't sorry, we got hits
Tell the DJ, "Play our shit!"

Sometimes I wish you just...
Well, if I told you what I'm really thinkin', it might make you blush
Yeah, but baby, so what?
And I don't wanna rush
We've been pretending we're just friends and all that stuff
For long enough, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin’ babe tonight
We start blurrin' up the lines

[Chorus]
Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me

[Verse 2]
I can't count on twenty hands
The nights I spent up wondering what it'd be like if you was my man
No, baby I can't
No, I can't help myself
Your touch is hypnotic, I want it
It ain't nothing like I've felt
From no one else, yeah

Cause I got plenty of 'em, I don’t need another friend

[Verse 1]
I was shorter than my dad's dining table
You were taller than my bedroom door frame
Hit me hard when I found height don't make a man, no
You grew smaller to me that Saturday when
You came crashing, crawling down through the back brush
Eyes were bloodshot and your leaden voice thin
You said, "I won't blame you now"
But I caught your cold somehow
Then you jumped right in

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So, for me, why won't you try?

[Verse 2]
Said you're sorry you were drinking through the day, then
Only stopped to let your lungs take the hit
You said, "I won't blame you now"
But you lost my love somehow
Then you jumped right in

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So, for me, why won't you try?

Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Verse 2]
And hey, babies, crawlin’ on the carpet
No, you won’t be that little for long
One day, you’ll move away, but you’re still gonna stay
This innocent after you’re gone

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever

He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did

I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...

And then he said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...
He said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...

So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late...)
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late...)
Oh...

He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no, no, no...)

[Verse 1]
There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

[Verse 2]
There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

[Chorus]
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Break on me
Put your head on my chest

Break on me
Break on me, baby
