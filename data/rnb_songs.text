[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreaming

But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me

[Verse 1]
You tell me you love me
But I ain't been feeling it lately
You say you love keeping me fly but
Can't keep me from looking' so crazy
Come in at 6 in the mornin'
Where you been, where you been?
Who is that texting your phone?
Just a friend, just a friend (okay)
My intuition never lies
There's nothing you can ever hide
Already got the screenshots
So there is no need to deny
You been creepin' and freakin' and sneakin'
Like you'll never lose me
Steady claiming that everyone know we together
But you steady choosing

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
But that ain't been keeping us stable
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine (hey, yeah)

[Chorus]
How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo and, I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

[Verse 2]
You don't like it
Now you telling' me that I should fight it
Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'
Why dish it out but can't take it
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him
Now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
How could you play me when the love I gave was real
I even took you back and you still had no chill

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you ain't gone ever learn
Play with fire you get burned
I don't think you'll understand
Until I hit you where it hurts
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine

[Chorus]
How would you like it if I do the things you do?
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo, and I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you (same to you)

[Outro]
All of those tears I cried
I can't count the lonely nights
Time and time again I've tried
So when I turn into a savage, boy, don't ask me why
Ask me why, don't ask me why, yeah
Give you a taste of your own medicine

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

[Verse 2]
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Let's get lost tonight (oh)

Baby, you and

[Verse 1]
I'm addied up, add it up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
’Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the Fall
Then it's time for me to fly out
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, he can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it

[Verse 3]
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy who
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all over now
Shout my nigga Stixx, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

All of them swallow
All of them swallow

All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know (Know)
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when (When)
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time (All the time), all the time (All the time), oh
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time (All the time), all the time (All the time)

And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night

[Intro: Wale & Miguel]
I'ma rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real
Hol' up
Lotus flower bomb firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flowerbomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby, you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you Mine

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be

Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Bridge: Miguel]

I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)

Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track

Pagbigyan mo na sana ako
'Di naman ako tulad ng inaakala mo

Kase 'di naman ako, fuckboy

[Verse 2: Emcee Rhenn]
Nagsimula eto sa fb nung makita ko larawan mo
Akala ko anghel, at nananaginip lang ako
Kaya dali-daling, at in-add na rin kita
Lumipas ang ilang saglit at ako'y in-accept mo na
Laking tuwa, Bumilog ang mata, sobra ang saya
Agad akong nag-chat sayo para mapansin mo na
Naging magkaibigan tayo, mabilis ang pangyayari
Kaso nga lang' langhiya, nung ang feelings ko'y sinabi
Sabi ko "gusto kita" hindi nagpaligoy-ligoy pa
Kaso lang tumanggi ka, kesyo may nalaman ka
Mga balibalita lang na hindi naman totoo
Fuckboy, manloloko tsaka sinungaling daw ako, nako

[Chorus]
Pagbigyan mo na sana ako
'Di naman ako tulad ng inaakala mo
'Di naman ako gwapo, wala ring auto
At ang kayang ibigay lang ay ang puso ko
Kaya 'wag mo na sana kong itaboy
Kase 'di naman ako, fuckboy
'Di naman ako fuckboy
'Di naman ako fuckboy

[Bridge]
Mahirap daw kase magtiwala
Hindi din madali ang maniwala
Sa mga pangako na maaari kong bitawan
Pero sana naman ay paniwalaan

[Chorus]
Pagbigyan mo na sana ako
'Di naman ako tulad ng inaakala mo
'Di naman ako gwapo, wala ring auto
At ang kayang ibigay lang ay ang puso ko
Kaya 'wag mo na sana kong itaboy
Kase 'di naman ako, fuckboy
'Di naman ako fuckboy
'Di naman ako fuckboy
'Di naman ako fuckboy

[Chorus]
Pagbigyan mo na sana ako
'Di naman ako tulad ng inaakala mo
'Di naman ako gwapo, wala ring auto
At ang kayang ibigay lang ay ang puso ko
Kaya 'wag mo na sana kong itaboy
Kase 'di naman ako, fuckboy

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, said she’s down for the night
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh, ooohh (slow down the time)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, down for the night

[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon, Kanye West & Elly Jackson]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Down for the night

[Bridge: Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
Been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for the night
Oh, oh, get down

Yo quiero hacerte tantas cosas sin enamorarte
Quiero que te sientas cómoda, así vamo' aparte
Así como tú quieras te hago el amor
Y pa' mí, modélame, bebé, en ropa interior

For me to think that you are the one for me
Left your baby mom, now Cardi's your wife-to-be
Ex had me locked up, but you came to set me free
They say you not my type, but you got my type of D
So answer this, can you hold me? Can I trust you?
Patek on the wrist, both arms, that's what us do
Mansion on the Hills, half/half if you want to (Want to), huh
That's only if you want to

[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a night

But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know

Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer, let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture

Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

Hey (No, no)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel

Wet your lips first, lick the tip now

Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke

Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
(Uh, hell no)
(You're not gonna make it, are you?)
Friendship and how it controls the world, hahaha
Hahaha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? They say they have to be...
Flying, super strength...
Alright, what's your name?
Maybe we can get a little—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the... dog, stop, stop, stop

And ships could fly. Buildings would be very, very tall
And everybody won't know the ground is up

Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
Probably, uh, being great
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very messy
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open and all in everything that I do
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know
Probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all
Just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer and I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
(It's probably up something really high, it's super high
I tried to land, like, a handstand or something)
Alright, that's it...
I spend a couple hours with my family and I go out
And do everything that I ever thought about trying
How far is a light year? How far is a light year?
(A second, a thousand years?)

[Chorus]
Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me

[Verse 1]
There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk about it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition is what you want
And it's something that I should know

[Pre-Chorus]
Something that I should know, uh
All the things that you went through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
Tell me, how can I right my wrongs?
That's something that I should know
All the things that we been through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no, no

[Chorus]
Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me

[Verse 2]
I say you don't need nobody else
Feels like you don't got me so you feel like you've been by yourself
I've been feeling kinda down myself
I've been going through it as well
Girl, I guess time will tell
That's the problem, I ain't got any left
There's some things I can't help
But you make the time for me
Oh, isn't that something that I should know?

[Pre-Chorus]
Something that I should know
All the things that you went through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no
And tell me how can I right my wrongs
That's something that I should know
All the things that we went through, girl I never meant to put you through it twice, no, no

[Chorus]
Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me

And you know that I believe it
Cause her pussy the meanest
She don't fuck with many niggas
She don’t fuck with any niggas
Yeah I call all the dibs on mine
I call all the nines and dimes
I put on my ice and sneaks
She puts on her ice and weave
We stay mobbin' for a week
Hit the strip while she’s asleep
Shawty know that I'm a freak
Shawty know that I'm a freak
And that's why you're curious soooo

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha!)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)
Whatchu mean, it ain't working? (What?)
Whatchu mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
Whatchu mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit...)
Whatchu mean? Whatchu mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No?)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh...)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid, that ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid, I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey butter, vodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger, all the kids know who I am
I need a honeybutter, puttin' lean in my Sprite can

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name, led to Hollywood
I was living off Ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night

So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won’t feel me 'till everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga

That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder

Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts

We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

And you're lying in your bed

Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)

Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again
Come again, come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out

Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

That thing, that thing, that thing

Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”, I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay, You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this: You’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?

[Verse 1]
If I could go back to the day we met
I would probably do it all over again
And I would choose not to be your friend
When you ask me, I'd just say I got a man
It wouldn't be no dates
It would be no staying late, at my house
It would be no watching movies on my couch
Shit went left, and now I'm just trying to figure out
Said "You'd always be my baby" then you bounced

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave like that?
When I gave you all I had
I gave you the real me
Told you all my feelings
And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me
I put that on my life that I ain't see this coming
Opened up my heart I should've never let you come in
But I wish you well though
That's all I could tell you
Maybe in your next life, you'll find everything you wanted

[Verse 2]
I never thought that loving you would cause me pain
I'll never put a man before myself again
You shoulda told me that you was uncertain
"This ain't what I wanted, this ain't working."
You was dead ass my baby, loved the shit out of you crazy
Shit is crazy how you could just turn around and try to play me
Boy, I know that we been going through some things
But just keep it real is all I'm saying

[Bridge]
I was the one loving you
I was the one cuffing you
Call me when you need me
I was the one coming through
Why didn't you believe in us?
How come you just couldn't love?
It wasn't that you didn't care
You just wasn't good enough

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave like that?
When I gave you all I had
I gave you the real me
Told you all my feelings
And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me
I put that on my life that I ain't see this coming
Opened up my heart I should've never let you come in
But I wish you well though

I know it hurts, you know I'd quench that thirst
(I can treat you better than her)
You say you're lonely, I say you'll think about it
'Cause you're the only one who resonates
That chase, mouth open like high

[Chorus]
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
(Mouth open, you're high)
Flying like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other
(Mouth open, you're high)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognize her
Mouth open, you're high

[Verse 2]
I know it hurts, you know I'd put you first
(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me, I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only one who instigates
Get your mouth open you're high

Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover (Mouth open, you're high)

Feel your body closing, I can rip it open
Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing
Smoke on your skin to get those pretty eyes rolling
My thighs are apart for when you're ready to breathe in
Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing
High motherfucker, get your mouth open, you know you're mine

[Chorus]
I'll put you first, just close your eyes and dream about it
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
I'll quench your thirst, just chase the high and stop your doubting
Flying like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other
High, high
High, high

He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya."
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin

Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk

Estelle once said to me, "Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now."
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinking
Ribena, I know what you're drinking
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow ‘cause all my clothes designer?
Uh, dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about

Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (oh, ooh)

With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear  blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast

But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now

But ten times out of nine, I'm only human

I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack

Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special

'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the policeman (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love

[Verse 1]
A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause

And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young

[Verse 2]
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck

[Outro]
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young

Part 2 - PERFECT

[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life

[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

To always forgive me
Ride or die with me
That's just what gangsters do

I'm fucked up, I'm black and blue
I'm built for it, all the abuse
I got secrets, that nobody, nobody, nobody knows
I'm good on, that pussy shit
I don't want, what I can get
I want someone, with secrets
That nobody, nobody, nobody knows

And running, all over you
Please take me to places, that nobody, nobody knows
You got me hooked up on the feeling
You got me hanging from the ceiling
Got me up so high I'm barely breathing
So don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me go

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly we hit the flight deck and got sprung
(Pww!) Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that…

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you’ll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that…

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now

You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care

Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (Hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me

Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)

That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (Let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low

In the club looking so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say

And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie

And we just got into it, here comes the endin'
You said this shit would happen, girl, that was your prediction
Said I'll never find no one like you and I should have listened
Who you fucking with now is that any of my business?
Whoever it is may not be finished
But...

[Chorus]
I'm comin' back for good
So let them niggas know it's mine
“I already got someone” is what you tell 'em every time
That shit ain't up for grabs
Where you at on the map?
I come to where you at
Fuck around and end up your last
I won't hold back

[Bridge]
I hope you still feel the same way
Don't say the same shit to me, you'll never change

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
I said it once, girl you so fine
Can we do it like old times?
Or nah, so fly
Oh why, didn't you
Tell me get my shit together and think it through?
A nigga just been sittin' here not knowin' what to do
Ayy, thinking shit like who's out there fucking you?
And who's keepin' you comfortable?

[Interlude]
She gon' give me a second chance or nah?
Did I make you fall in love again or nah?
Fuck them other niggas, you're mine
Hey baby
Hey, girl

[Outro]
I'm so different
Nothin' like them other niggas
Nothin' like them other niggas
Nothin' like them other niggas
You're so different
Nothin' like them other bitches
Nothin' like them other bitches
Nothin' like them other bitches
Comin' back for good so let them...
Niggas know it's mine...
Someone is what you tell 'em...
Every time
Every time
Every time...

[Verse 1]
Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Verse 2]
I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just wanna be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
O-o-oh! Seems so fitting for

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)

Talk to me baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up
Girl I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight


You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected girl you're such a masochist and I ask why

And you reply...

I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby please
Would you end your night with me
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life

Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart

I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
Yeah

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, (haha, on my sleeve)
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say "guess what?" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days

What I am trying to say is
(What I am trying to say is)

The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright...

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Bridge: Rikrok]
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me, Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy, y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

[Verse 3: SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your *beep* is weak buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit

Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all

Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together

We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, "Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do," I can actually let it go...

If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' 'bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That  knowing the difference can make all the difference

Maybe she can come lay do after we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no, she didn't, ooh yes, I did
Oh no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together

It made me feel good for temporary love

But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors

[Verse 1]
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold  (she loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
The truth, the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

[Chorus]
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
Enough, enough

She loves everybody

She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even fucked with you
Trust issues, that shit made me feel uncomfortable
I should've never made you feel like I was stuck with you
You ever had somebody say that they was down for you?
They made it feel so real like they really down for you
They clown on you every time they turn around on you
They not loyal, they happy, they lookin' down on you
You really jacking, you don't fuck with me
Now I feel like you never kept it a buck with me
You saying I ain't the daddy, that would be luckily
I'm hoping that ain't my baby, that shit gon' fuck with me
You had me looking like a clown, bitch
That other nigga gon' fuck up running his mouth, bitch
How I fuck him up and drown him in a fountain
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

[Chorus]
But now I'm like, "What the fuck, nigga?"
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
No kissing and even hugging
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love with it
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I just wanted to fuck with you
Thought you was cool to kick it, probably get lunch with you
I never meant for shit to get so fucking comfortable
Your niggas told you they was down for you
But when you fucked up, nigga, they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou' for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her
I'm a loser, I feel like a fucking loser
Fuck the rumors 'cause I passed her back to ya
Ran through her, then I passed her back to ya
Hah!
But now I'm feeling like I'm, ahh!
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

My nigga, we don't fuck… wit' ya

I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your toothbrush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know what a ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl
Two-seater, for me and you in a Bimmer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit' it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch, you did it
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosin'
I don't know how I go through wit' it, I go through wit' it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don't fuck… wit' ya
So why you fuck wit' us?
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches

Getting sober for a day
Got me feeling too low
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live
I'm about to lose control
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer
Camo'd out, leather booted
Kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome, then some
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now we sitting in the back saying

This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for

Yeah
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall
That's a serious question because I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream XO, when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working
Nigga, champagne...

This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

Painted in your golden kiss, honey dripping from your lips
I thank God and my lucky stars
Darling, don't you know what you are?
Yeah, baby, you are

Tomorrow comes and goes before you know (Yeah, baby)
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing (Yeah, yeah)
But nothing can compare to when you're naked

So I just had to let you know (Oh, know, yeah)
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Hey

[Coro: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

[Verso 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Él vino a buscarme y ahí lo supe (uh)
Vi clara su actitud
Me dijo: "son tantas las que yo tuve" (uh)
Pero me faltas tú
No puedo soltarte, no seas tan cruel (hey)
Desde esa noche azul
Mi papá me dice que malo es él (uh)
¿Qué más puedo hacer?

[Pre-Coro: Camila Cabello]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lo supe en un segundo
Él cambiaría mi mundo
Ya no puedo más
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ay y es que me duele mucho
Decir adiós, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, ooh na-na

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Soy el domador de todas las nenas malas
Muchos corazones clavado en el sofá de mi sala
Todavía recuerdo lo que le dije aquella mañana
La primera que quiero como la Habana
Mami ¿qué bolá?, ooh-na-na
Ta' acompañada o andas sola, ooh-na-na (sola, sola)
Pero que fácil me descontrola, ooh-na-na
Tú me quemas, vuelves y me enrolas, me enrolas (ah, ah)
Llegamo' pal' mambo, suéname el tambor
Pa' que te recuerdes de La Habana y el campo
La libertad que bien te sabe
¿Cuándo volverá? sólo Dios sabe
Mami ¿qué bolá?, ooh-na-na
Ta' acompañada o andas sola, ooh-na-na (sola, sola)
Pero que fácil me descontrola, ooh-na-na
Tú me quemas, vuelves y me enrolas
Camila y Ramón Ayala de un pájaro son las dos alas, oh-oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back

This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming

And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring

And all gorillas don't want bananas 'less your chain is tucked
You wiggity-wack with the strap, you cross Chris, make you jump

Leave that shit for the chumps, I still get what I want
Don't wanna believe in my mind, but you believe in my dump

Nigga look at my eyes, you 'bout to give me my bonus
And every motherfuckin' record, that's a hit, I record it (Celebrate)
And e'ry motherfuckin' snitch up in this bitch, they report it (Celebrate)
You paid your way for this fade and can't even afford it

And all these bad bitches can't keep their feet down (Elevate)
You don't really wanna see Brown
Need to stop all that shit talkin', put the seat down
Joyner, I don't really feel these niggas
Hol' up, I ain't gotta pay to kill these niggas
Time is money, need to fuck around and bill these niggas

Make it make sense
Make it make sense, I
Can't hide a heart in a black tint, I
You were off the bullshit and the tablets
Under 21, both savage
All these blurry nights feel the same to me
Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you gonna blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober
Hey, I'm the one you call when you feelin' low
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight 'cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rockstar crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all the love

Uh, ayy, ayy, uh
Been a minute since I heard you wanna stay as friends
I learned from my mistakes, you make me want to learn again
I don't really see the problem, it's a risk I wanna take
You say, "Let's see where it goes," but I don't really wanna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been smiling when we fuck
Let's not even think about it, we ain't gotta talk a lot
Make it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jams on, I wanna see you make it pop, ayy
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ayy
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ayy
I'ma treat you good like you've been waitin' for your turn, ayy
Nothing in the universe feel better than your tongue, ayy
'Bout to go home, I know you finna come with

Conversations late night about how we gonna live
I don't got the answer to it, all I'm finna say is

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off  of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

[Verse 2]
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
(I miss you B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every day that passes
Is a day that I get closer
Every move I make, every single day
To seeing you again
We miss you B.I.G
Every night I pray, every step I take
And we won't stop
'Cause we can't stop
Every move I make, every single day

And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do

I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
If you ain't on site, then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them

I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body Benz servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth

Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast

Irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human
I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon and start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

[Verse 2]
And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving
It's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?

After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fuckin' 20, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? (Woah)
I hear noises in the bathroom (Woah)
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it

Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place, yeah

I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

And real life is stranger than my dreams

Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

Never worry 'bout what I do

From your head to your toes, out of control

Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

Punish me, please

Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right

Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent

Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby

Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me

So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)

Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under

She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest"
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Alright, uh
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me "make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you

Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I know you want it, boy

Just keep on pushin'

Just close your eyes and

[Verse 1]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 2]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep

[Verse 3]
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep

I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

[Chorus: Rihanna & SZA]
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me

No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

[Verse 3: Blackstreet]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

[Hook]
No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)

No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)

We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down," Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history, baby (That's right, that's right), maybe (That's right, that's right)
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you

"Boy this thing is really, really goes high!"
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

And your friends sayin', "let him go"

(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh baby
I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new

Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

May the last one burn into flames

Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Tell the tide, "Don't move"

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice

Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?

[PART I]

One, two, one two…
Thought I told you not to trust these hoes
Say they love you, when you know they don’t
Say they will, but shit, you know they won’t
Yeah, you hear me, you don’t feel me, though
And you are not the only one…
You are not the only one…
You are not the only one…
You are not the only one…

Okay, fuck it
It was Dominik, David, Braden
All of them did the same to you
Marquis and Sean and Brian
All of them had they way with you
Ever so often you get lost and miss out on everything
Shout-out to Krissy
That’s my bitch ’cause she tells me everything
And I was not the only one
I was not the only one to you…
So I was the only lonely one…

Really, we had the perfect end…
That night we shared at the Comfort Inn…
We made love like the world would have ended…
If either of us had admitted..
We were in love…
So I was the only one…

And I should’ve never took you on a boat for your birthday
And I should’ve never fucked you on a boat on your birthday
And I never would’ve came into your house in the first place
If I would’ve known that you would hurt me like in the worst way
‘Cause that night turned into every weekend and
Every weekend turned to every evening
You took me out and left me in the deep end then
Quis found out and then I had to leave him
‘Cus I couldn’t be the one to hurt him
Plus I thought you were the one so it was worth it
But really we should’ve just ended it
That day I was at your crib when...
Your baby mama just burst in,damn

I was weak then and you knew it
I was so weak then and you proved it

[PART II]

‘Cus my brother was dying
And you gave me a shoulder to cry on
It was nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing
If it's nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing
Then why’d you...
Then why’d you call it love?
Oh oh

And I was not only one who was hurting
And you were not the only one with the burdens
But if we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing
Why would you call this love when you knew that it wasn’t?
Why would you call it love when you knew that it wasn’t?
If this was not love then please tell me what was it
If this was not love then please tell me what was it

‘Cause when I met you at my favorite store
And I saw you working at the door ....

Y yo puesto pa' buscarte cuando me necesitas

Un selfie tirándome beso'
Voy de camino a bajarte el queso
Cuando cruzé la linea no me equivoqué

Bruto, bruto con cojone'
Siempre usando el condón
Y pa' colmo te pone toda' mis cancione'
Pa' dejarlo te di sesenta y nueve mil razones
Tu toto late por mí más que 12 corazones
Y lo hacemo' lento, cuando nos besamo', se detiene el tiempo
Sin palabra', disfrutamos el momento... y repetimos el cuento

A-Apreciando toda tu desnudez
Cuando mi lengua corría toda tu piel
Me hicieron para ti (oh-oh)
Lo supiste cuando gritabas mi nombre (hey)
Baby, yo soy el que te corresponde (ah)
Qué rico fumar antes de comernos
El destino nos cambió to' los planes (yeah)
Tú dime cuándo pa' volver a vernos (wuh)
Tienes algo más cabrón, ya olvídate de él

¿Cómo quieras, papi? ¿Rápido o lento?
Soy adicta a tu movimiento
Y aunque hay veces que yo te miento
En las noches se me nota lo que siento por ti
La gente diciéndono’ que somo' anormale'
Siempre nos comemo' como si fuésemo' animale'
Es lógico que me reclame'
Y sabes que si estoy con él, me llama' y desarmo los plane'
Sabe' bien que como yo no hay dos
Prendiendo uno, haciéndolo
Olvidándono' del reloj
Y que cuando ella te habla, tú te imagina' mi voz
Yo ya lo descubrí, que tú eres para mí, que yo soy para ti
Baby, quédate aquí, más cerquita de mí, él no me lo hace así

[Coro: Cazzu & Alex Rose]
Tú quieres comerme toda
Él me lo hace a medias, tú me besa' toda
Quédate conmigo y picheale a toda'
Como yo ninguna, yo le gano a toda'

I think I'm fucking gone, rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeli'g I would give to

I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeli'g I would give to

Oh, you

And I know you wouldn't leave

They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

Y'all don't gotta answer for whenever you text me
It's multiple choice and they all wanna test me

Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more

Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

You're missing me the way I'm missing you

To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone

Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

Yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go

[Verse 3: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell nah
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell nah (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care

[Verse 4: Victoria Monét, Ariana Grande & Both]
Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)

I'm so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code
She the cheat code (Yeah)

Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Bridge]
Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me?
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin' in the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

Trippin' on that drank, but I know she worth it
Independent baby, I know she workin'
Adriana's serving drinks, 20 bottles, urgent
I know it can be better but nobody's perfect
We flirted for a minute, DeJ, that's my baby
I ain't trippin', I'm like Henny, yeah I'm in her kidneys
She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, "Damn Durk I like the way you hittin' it"
Don't believe the rumors, girl
You know I'll do you, girl
I don't wanna hear the shit about the niggas
That tried to do you, girl
Fuck the past right now
Shawty got you right now
And you hot right now
You can get it right now, baby

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I let him get it when he want it, knock it down and push up on it
I was plottin' for a while, now I got him where I want him
They didn't understand none of this was planned
99 problems but a bitch better not be none
Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?
Durk and DeJ
I'm thinkin' 'bout changin' my last name

Ooh, I like the way she move

You and I
White dress, flowers, and a suit and tie
Me and you like Bonnie and Clyde
No beat the case, we're do or die
Who am I to say you ain't natural?
Your haters my haters, ain't switchin' up, baby, I got you
I'm with her like a tattoo
The way you wear that dress, they gon' attack you
The way you look at me, baby I got you
I hit it from the front, I like the back too
She say, "Lay down so I can ride you"
I know that she feinding
She scratchin' my back, I like how she screamin'
I fuck her and leave her, she feinding
Shawty my Beyoncé

Controllin' how you moving, lucid dreamin' (Dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood (It's lit!)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (Yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah!)
Bend her over for some piping (It's lit!)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightning (Pop it)
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep (Sleep)

Want a drop top on the beach (Straight up!)
Getting me hot, yeah (Yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh!
And if I OD, I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo
And the doors goin' up, suicide

[Chorus 1: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets

Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it

[Intro]
Ooh, oh oh
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
"I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Outro]
Baby, when you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, haha, yeah

I hope she's speedin' on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to a baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash
Crash into a ditch (Just playin')

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

[Chorus: André 3000]
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo-boo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-boo-ooh
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, I
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh

You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me

'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body

The heat of a thousand fires

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh

Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it

All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

And if you get too high

Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that butt 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Bridge: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)

People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest

Promising everything I do not mean

Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time

Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

Got the club going up on a Tuesday

It ain't no way no how
I made it on my own, I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go
You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

Got the club going up on a Tuesday

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Girl, I'll come to put myself between your legs
Not between your heart
Can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?

Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't

Don't you bleed on out, oh

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

[Verse 4]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

There’s nothing like summer in the city

And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it

[HAMILTON]
I hadn’t slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

[MARIA]
I know you are a man of honor
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…

[HAMILTON]
She said:

[MARIA]
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone
I don’t have the means to go on

[HAMILTON]
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

[MARIA]
You’re too kind, sir

[HAMILTON]
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

[MARIA]
This one’s mine, sir

[HAMILTON]
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

[MARIA]
Stay?

[HAMILTON]
Hey…

[MARIA]
Hey…

[HAMILTON]
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”

[MARIA]
Whoa...

[HAMILTON]
Nooo, show me how to

[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]
Say no to this

[HAMILTON]
I don’t know how to

[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]
Say no to this

[HAMILTON]
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go

[ENSEMBLE]
Go! Go! Go!

[HAMILTON]
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…

[ENSEMBLE]
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

[HAMILTON]
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

[JAMES]
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

[HAMILTON]
Fuuuu—

[JAMES]
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife

[HAMILTON]
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:

[MARIA]
No, sir!

[HAMILTON]
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

[MARIA]
Please don’t go, sir!

[HAMILTON]
So was your whole story a setup?

[MARIA]
I don’t know about any letter!

[HAMILTON]
Stop crying
Goddamnit, get up!

[MARIA]
I didn’t know any better

[HAMILTON]
I am ruined...

[MARIA & HAMILTON]
Please don’t leave me with him helpless (I am helpless—how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
I don’t want you
Whatever you want (I don’t want you)

[MARIA, HAMILTON, & ENSEMBLE]
If you pay (I don’t…)
You can stay
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this (Say no to this!)
Tonight (I don’t know how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this
'Cause the situation’s helpless (Helpless)
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes” (Whoa!)
How can you (No, show me how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this? (Say no to this)
(Say no to this!)
How can I say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go (Go! Go! Go!)
When her body’s on mine I do not say… (No!)

[HAMILTON, MARIA, & ENSEMBLE]
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
Say no to this…
I don’t say no to this (Don’t say no to this)
There is nowhere I can go
Go go go...

[Intro]
I should've stayed at home
'Cause right now I see all these people that love me
But I still feel alone
Can't help but check my phone
I coulda made you mine
But no, it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you
And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy

[Chorus]
And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

[Verse]
But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else
More beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world

[Bridge]
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
I said that
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
Best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I say that I'm happy
I say that I'm happy
But no, no, no, no
No, no, no, oh

[Chorus]
I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
And I can't wait to be your number, your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one
I might just be the one

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

Why you rushing me, baby?
It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed

I've been alone for too long
Ohh, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is "La vie en rose"
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see "La vie en rose"

[Verse 2]
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
"La vie en rose"

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyoncé]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up

Can you try me? (try me), try me (try me)
Once you put your pride aside
You can notify me (-fy me), -fy me (-fy me)
You're the best I ever had
Baby girl, remind me (-mind me), -mind me (-mind me)
Let me know if it's on
And you know where to find me, find me
Havin' thoughts you never had, yeah

[Verse]
I didn't know you were down for him finding out
I thought you had some kind of love for your man
Well, I'm not tryna break up something
You've been workin' out, you've been steady
But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me
Don't you tempt me
You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you
It might have been, been about a couple months
But I just got the picture that you texted to me
You ain't steady, you look ready to go all the way
If you let me take you down on me

[Chorus]
Can you try me? (try me), try me (ooh)
Once you put your pride aside (once you put your pride aside)
You can notify me (-fy me), -fy me (-fy me)

Havin' thoughts you never had, yeah
Can you try me? Try me, try me (Hey)
Once you put your pride aside

Don't you miss me, babe?
Don't you miss me, baby?


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe-, this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

[Bridge]
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

[Verse 3]
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon (In the dark)

[Outro]
(In the dark)

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I
I will not waiver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit the Wall Street traffic, took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the zzz's (Uh)
Poppin' the polar opposite to the NZT (Uh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name brand (Name brand)
But I done seen how the Xan did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone till November
All my city calls me Simba
Dreams are made for cages, nigga
Lions are for real, nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills, nigga
Fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

Sure, I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slumber and I'm stuck here with the vultures

You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me

Ohhh... I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you

Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roam never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)

I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that

Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass

And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya (splashhhh)
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost

You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion

You so damn important
Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Don’t tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’ma drive it like it’s stolen
I’ma fix it like it’s broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions

Pssh, girl, didn’t I tell you at the damn club?
We gon’ wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don’t gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

Only thing I know is you’re my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin’
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
Hand me the brush and say “paint it”
Give me your heart and I hold it
Show me your soul and I'll mold it
Baby boy, you gotta be the dopest
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz

Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)

I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I gon' get it, I'll be good
Oh... oh man, oh, ah, ugh

Pat, Zuli, where...
Oh fuck, oh my God
Why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh, mh

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

[Outro]

If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space

I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

[Chorus]
Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

[Verse 3]
So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

Girl, I still got you, oh-ohh
And I got you, ooh, woah

No, you ain't like them bitches
Tell them hoes adios
And you can drop your panties
Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember (I know you remember)

Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

On drank and let's all get faded, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

[Hook]
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)

[Verse 2]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB (ah)

How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)

Part I: Stay Ready

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreaming
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You've probably been waiting forever
So how does it sound:
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]
Come to me, come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

Part II: What a Life

All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what you're given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doin' like
Whatever gets me through the night
What a life
I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control

[Hook 2: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
They say
The truth ain't pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
And you know plenty
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' bout
'Cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty
If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life that I've been given
What a life
What a life that I've been living
What a life
What a life we die to live in
What a life

[Verse 1]
Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult
You know I be difficult
You know it get difficult too

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Verse 2]
For real, I'm not playing no games
Boy, we back and forth
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Prolly hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive about havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Skit: Granny]
You don't have shit to say to me
I ain't got shit to say to you
Granny, and that's the truth
And step, and step on
Also you black heffa, yeah you, you stand your ground
'Cause I feel the same way
If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way you work that one

Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

Yo
People'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on 'em

[Pre-Chorus]

We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills 'n' potions

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Pre-Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

[Outro]
Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)

Mind

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine…

[Chorus]
If we
Tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate
Is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don’t mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea

Where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know
When I’m next to her for sure
It's like you on my mind all day
Get this off my chest
Ah damn, I know I love you
I swear your shit the best
Friends, they know they hate
Get that off my chest
Ah yeah, I think I love you
Oh baby, maybe...

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta (Busta, busta)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number (Uh, uh)
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere (No, no)
No, I don't want none of your time and (Uh)

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Whoo)
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 2: Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli (Left Eye)]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and (Said no)

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, love
No scrub, love

A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride

We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m alone

In a glass house still throwing stones
Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones
(Happy in love)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
Just hood ass niggas in designer suits (ooh)
Follow my moves on a truth in Alaïa boots, yeah, yeah
Amelia Earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
Fake news y'all choose, we no lie
No photoshop, just real life
(Happy in love)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Damn, look at us now
Pray, pray for the vows
Way up now, it's a long way, a long way down
We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all
We came, and we conquered, now we're happy in love
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)

She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'

Un endroit où tout l'monde s'en tape de ma life

[Refrain]
J'me tire, me demande pas pourquoi j'suis parti sans motif
Parfois je sens mon cœur qui s'endurcit
C'est triste à dire mais plus rien n'm'attriste
Laisse-moi partir loin d'ici
Pour garder l'sourire, je me disais qu'y'a pire
Si c'est comme ça, bah fuck la vie d'artiste
Je sais qu'ça fait cliché d'dire qu'on est pris pour cible
Mais j'veux l'dire juste pour la rime

[Outro]
J'suis parti sans mentir, sans me dire
"Qu'est-ce que j'vais devenir ?"
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, Meu-gui
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, vas-y !
Parti sans mentir, sans me dire
"Qu'est ce que j'vais devenir ?"
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, Meu-gui
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, vas-y !

[Refrain]
J'me tire, me demande pas pourquoi j'suis parti sans motif
Parfois je sens mon cœur qui s'endurcit
C'est triste à dire mais plus rien n'm'attriste
Laisse-moi partir loin d'ici
Pour garder l'sourire, je me disais qu'y'a pire
Si c'est comme ça, bah fuck la vie d'artiste
Je sais qu'ça fait cliché d'dire qu'on est pris pour cible
Mais j'veux l'dire juste pour la rime

[Verse 1]
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)
Don’t hold back

[Verse 2]
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth

Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out

Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
(Nothing is going to change my love for you)

Don’t hold back, let it out

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga, wasn't you?
I should have never even fucked with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though
I'ma keep that shit a stack 'til my fucking time go
Niggas throw you in the shade cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo
Man I can't believe they killed my fucking bro Quado
Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe

This is all I ever wanted nigga
Why would I let you take it from me nigga?

Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you?
You been plottin', nigga wasn't you?
I should have been watching from the jump with you
Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

[Verse 2]
Started, what I started
Anybody want a problem, this is my shit
Tell 'em if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a ménage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon

Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga wasn't you?

I was walking in the rain with my Timbs on
Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm
13 on my Balmains, it's a big storm
In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck witcha
Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas
Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas
It's just us nigga

[Bridge 2]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
That jungle turned me into a monster

That jungle turned me to a monster

That jungle turned me to a monster

I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

To say that we're in love is dangerous

I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted

Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real,) yeah

The fast life keeps gaining on me (the fast life keeps gaining on me,) shit
But ever since I met you (ever since I met you)
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe

I'm not tryna talk at all
Tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous

[Verse 1]
You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless

Mama taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

Of breaking glass on my Range Rover

Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

You don't own me
You don't own me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 2: Grace]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 3: Grace]
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

You don't own me
You don't own me
You don't, you don't
You don't own me
You don't own me

I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I, I need you so
'Cause right now you know that nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

[Verse 2]
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly, don't even know why
I-I honestly don't even know why

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'

Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect

"Listen, listen"

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding

Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

[Verse 1]
She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

Your cries, they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs

You're all I need

(Don't you love when I come around)
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody

Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her...man

I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms

Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used that shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Chorus]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Chorus]
Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror

You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

It's no thing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes

And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

And some nights you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it

Give us, just tonight, night, night

Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
That you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you, got to
Love you, love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost in... my doubt

Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly so high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) the fuckin' wolves"

How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it, girl; I'm 'bout whatever though

Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you

Juicy thing, make that pussy sing

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it

Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom

Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

[Bridge 1]
And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

[Verse 2]
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Bridge 2]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
'Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away
(I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

[Verse 3]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em
He one nights 'em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Bridge 3]
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

[Outro]
And though I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to

Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world

Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

So, baby, let's just turn down the lights

While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all

Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile

Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty

We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No)
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now)

You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
I know I always come and go (And go)
But it's out of my control

These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Ba-Ba-Baby
This is something you should know
I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glow
Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexin' on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought?
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy
Well, he mad as fuck, when they sex she scream for me, ayy
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'ma start by sayin' this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse 2: Monty]
Oh, baby girl, you can stay the night 'til the morn'
All this ice on my arm, what you like, what you want?
And I might put you on, bitch, it's mine can't you see?
And I rock seventeen, all these knots in my jeans
Me and Zoo turnin' up, got your boo in the cut
And she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
Cause baby you the baddest, all this money, I'ma cash it
And I'm swervin' all in traffic
While I'm trapping out the mansion
And I'm moving through the tri-state
Do two-hundred on the highway
And I'm swerving in my i8
Baby, you should come my way
Squad!

Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it

Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry

[Intro: Lenny Tavarez]
(Oh-oh-oh; eh
Mmm-mmm, mm-mmm
Yo')

[Pre-Estribillo: Paulo Londra & Lenny Tavarez]
Ey, baby, no, oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
No ve' que me estoy muriendo
Porque un ratito me regale' tu atención, oh-oh-oh (-ción, -ción)
Estoy perdido en ese azul de tus ojos, yeh
Ey, baby, no, no-oh-oh (No-oh-oh)
No ves que me estoy muriendo
Porque un ratito me regales tu atención, oh-oh-oh-oh
Estoy perdido en el azul de tus ojos, yeh

Nena maldición, nena maldición (Eh)
Yo ni te conozco pero jugaría con vos
Nena maldición, ey, nena maldición, yo'
Yo ni la conozco pero jugaría con vos (Mmm-mmm)

[Verso 1: Paulo Londra]
Mirada fría como la nieve, me congela hasta no dar má'
Si me toca hace que me eleve, hasta ni ver toa' la ciudad
Compraría lo que ella quiere con tal que venga para acá
Estaríamo' como se debe, relajao' sin un problema
Seguro tiene mil pretendientes, pero ni uno valiente
Para hacerle ternuras sin miedo a qué diga la gente
Yo sé bien lo que siente, sé muy bien lo que siente
Que to' somos iguale' con los mismo' errores de siempre

[Pre-Estribill: Paulo Londra, Lenny Tavarez & Ambos]
Ey, baby, no, oh-oh-oh (No, oh-oh)

Estoy perdido en el azul de tus ojos, yeh (¡Wuh!)

Yo ni la conozco pero jugaría con vos
Nena maldición, eh, nena maldición (Bebé)
Yo ni te conozco pero jugaría con vos

[Verso 2: Lenny Tavarez & Paulo Londra]
Úsame, úsame, úsame
Hazme tuyo, dale, bésame
Como en el colegio vamo' a aprender
Quemando vemo' el amanecer
Tú-tú-tú-tú-tú (Y salimo')
Con lo' ojo' azule' (-zu', -zule')
Yo con los ojo' rojo' (ro-rojo')
Se te seca la boca y con mi lengua te la remojo (Sh-sh-sh)
Quiero ser Messi y tú mi Antonella
Prepárate pa' vivir una novela
Soy exclusivo, no de cualquiera
Por eso quiero que tú sea' mi nena
Por siempre mi nena; yo'

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me

Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

Don't now, don't stop it

Baby, I don't, I don't need to own you

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown

[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?

What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Whoa

[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles

Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

[Verse 2]
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Chorus]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine

Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

I'm so fucking happy you're alive
Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusin' your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in a hotel room

It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'

And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top

Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la

Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said, "I can't say no to nobody"
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, "How my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Ilang beses pa ba na kitang papayuhan?
Ayaw ko lang naman na ikaw ay masaktan
Hindi kita sa dina-down down down 'pag pumili ka
Kase karamihan kasi now kung makuha madali
Madali lang magpakamot 'pag may nangati
Kaya ngayon palang mag-isip ka 'pre (yah, yah, yah)

[Verse 2: Flow-G]
'Wag kang mangangamba kung iiwanan ka na nya
'Wag kang mag-alala kasi marami pang iba
Idaan mo lang sa tawa kaysa magpakatanga
Hanggang sa masanay ka na kasi ganyan talaga sila
Baka 'di mo alam na hindi na bilang
Sa daliri ang binibining sasaktan ka lang
Kaya easy ka lang, 'wag kang magpakahibang
'Wag mong gawing mundo yung alam mo na tao lang
Alam mo yan kaya 'wag mo nang lokohin ang sarili mo
Hayaan mo sila na maglaway, kakatingin sa'yo
Hanggang sa silang lahat naman ang maghabol sa'yo
'Pag nagawa mo yan ay tsaka na'ko bibilib sa'yo

[Chorus: Bosx1ne]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo, lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Verse 3: Brandon]
Gagamitin lang nila ang 'yong pagiging sikat
Sabi ko sa'yo diba, 'di lahat ay tapat?
Na mga bitches na tanging riches
'Wag ilahat ang pagkatao mo at feelings
From the beginning hindi sapat!
Hu u? ka na 'pag gusto napasakamay
Unti-unti kang gagamitin para sokeramai
Kaya tawanan mo na lang pare, 'di yan kawalan
Dapat tayo yung lalaki na iniiyakan

[Refrain: Brandon & Bosx1ne]
Kaya hayaan mo sila na maghabol sa'yo
Para 'lam nila 'di tayo basta basta pwedeng sayonara
Kaya sa'kin magtiwala madami pa d'yang iba
Konti na lang tayong pogi sa mundong natitira

[Verse 4: Bullet D]
Di ba sabi ko sa'yo, wag nang uulit?
Ang kulit mo ring kaibigan ka (Hey! Hey!)
Ilang beses na ang puso mo'y napunit
Nagagalit pag sinasabihan ka (Oh yeah!)
Makinig ka sa akin alam ko na rin
Galawan ng babaeng ikaw ay papaasahin
Kaya kung ako sa'yo ay 'wag na (wag na)
Tanga yung taong nandyan na para sa kanya
Kaso binalewala dahil lang sa salita
Ang lakas lakas manggamit ng hindi mo halata
Ganyan na talaga ang nagiging sitwasyon ngayon
Wala na akong masabi basta alam mo na 'yon
Kung ano yun!

[Chorus: Bosx1ne]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo, lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Verse 5: Skusta Clee]
De-de-de There's so many bitches in the club (In The Club)
There's so many sexy babies ba't hindi ka maghanap?
Iinom nalang natin kasi yan!
Bawal ang malungkot pare, hindi pwede yan!
Sa 'kin makinig ka pare!
Sa panahon ngayon wala ng matinong babae
Maniwala ka sa 'king mga sinasabi
Alam ko 'yan kasi diyaan ako nadale
So it's time to say goodbye-bye, say goodbye
'Dun sa girlfriend mong tsupay, set up tonight
Wala nang chick ngayon na totoo
Lahat nagloloko ay nako, kung ako sa'yo (Ohhhh..)
Kalimutan mo na yan!

[Verse 6: Jroa]
Hey dude, just listen to me now
I say, I say hey dude, 'wag kang magpahibang
Dami-dami diyang iba, 'wag kang magpakatanga
Buksan mo lang ang mata at ika'y mamamangha
See them pretty ladies in the club tonight
Ba't 'di ka pa kasi maghanap? (Yeah, right)
Itapon mo ang nakaraan, bye bye
Buddy, just stop wastin' your time
'Wag mo na kasing pilitin pa
Kung ako sa'yo, mag-enjoy ka
Hayaan mo na maghabol sila
Ituro mo diyan sa 'kin at tutulungan kita na kalimutan
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Bosx1ne & Skusta Clee]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo, lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Outro: All Members of OC.D and ExB]
Hayaan mo sila na, hayaan mo sila na
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo
Hayaan mo sila na, hayaan mo sila na
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo
Hahayaan mo sila, hahayaan mo sila
Hahayaan mo sila na maghabol sa'yo
Hahayaan mo sila, hahayaan mo sila
Hahayaan mo sila na maghabol sa'yo (Tahahaha!)

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

[Verse 2: André 3000]
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...

[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Lo mein)

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause—

[Chorus]
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)

We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)

Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself

And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings

Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin')
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah)
And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin')
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (ride it baby)
This sex will get you high without no other substance

Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?)
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?)
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot)
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (blowin' up their spot)
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings (feelings)

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, "Ho" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

We all have regrets sometimes
We wish to go back in time

Don't you wish you changed your past?
'Cause it's so bad

Is that why you tried to quit three times?
Is that why you said goodbye, retired?

You used to work at Whataburger
Now you pop your pussy for the Warner Brothers

Shots fired, you’re fired

Your kitty looks like a flat tire (Eww!)

[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it

I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe

And tell me how it's looking babe

Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

Oh, baby baby be sweating out my hair

Hello!
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ayy, yeaaah baby

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
Uh, yeah, Monty
Tell me what you see
Is it money or it’s me?
I smoke twenty, smell the weed

They like, "Monty, can you be my baby daddy?"
I’m like, "Yeah"
I got Robins on my jeans
You see the wings on every pair
All you see is Remy Boyz
You know my niggas everywhere
And if somebody got a problem
We could meet up anywhere
Now go say something
Don’t you niggas play dumb
You know where we came from
You don’t want sauce, no A1

I'm like, yeah, she's fine

If you like it, we can swerve, we can light and stain up here
Blowing, pluck it out the window
We get playing, press rewind, got her singing every time
Take a high note for me, girlfriend
Got my city looking rude
I ain't Diddy, I ain't Loon, but I think I need a girlfriend
She feeling great as I'm talking to her
She a RemyGirl, so I'm gon' pursue her
I brought a lot of loud, lot of Remy to sip on
Thousand dollars when I get my tip on
I'm off her, asked her if her fatty real
She said that's all her, got her with the happy feel
I'm 'bout to spoil her, got her with the happy feel
I'm 'bout to spoil her, oh my

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies

[Verse 1]
I'm like, "Hey, what's up? Hello"
I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap, I'm livin' 50 thousand K how I stand though
If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like…

[Chorus]
And I get high with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies

[Refrain]
I'm like, "Hey, what's up? Hello"
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go

[Verse 2]
I be smokin' dope and you know Backwoods what I roll
Remy Boyz, Fetty eatin' shit up, that's fasho
I'll run in ya house, then I'll fuck your ho
'Cause Remy Boyz or nothin'
Re-Re-Remy Boyz or nothin', yeah

[Outro: Nitt Da Gritt]
Yeah, you hear my boy
Soundin' like a zillion bucks on the track
I got whatever on my boy, whatever
Put your money where your mouth is
Money on the wood make the game go good
Money out of sight cause fights
Put up or shut up, huh?

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you

The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty

Hustle Gang Homie
One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore

Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

Must not have had enough money to solve 'em

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh

And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure

Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Blue used to be my favorite color

For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank

You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm!
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong

We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I know you're thinkin' I'm cold

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me

I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

We woke up in the kitchen

That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple

And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "we" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no
Yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once

And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care, long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh-oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you, what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

The things I can't change are the reason you love me

I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen

[Verse 1]
This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)

[Chorus]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 1]
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir
Check

[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)

So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 2]
For real shawty
You already know

[Verse 3]
Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul

Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no

There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)

Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit

As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big, when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet
On your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear

Would you like it better
If I hit the West Coast?
Tell me baby if you 'bout that life right now

No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'd yo bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg

If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so

Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"

I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga

Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

Send me your location, let's

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight

I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

Tell me, have you heard that lately?

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here

And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had

Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."

Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything

I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm
Mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears

Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost

She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Turn it up and throw a tantrum

Hook up with someone random

This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag

This that, "Who's all there?"
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

[Verse 1]
I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said "don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste of

For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)

Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
Can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane

Novacane for the pain, for the pain
Can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her

You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

Life, it goes on, what can you do?

Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup

But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes

And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone

And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge]
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe

You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters

You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless

God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé]
I wake up looking this good
(God damn, God damn, God damn)
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit

I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight

Do you feel the same as well?

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

You're tellin' me that I'm insane

What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love? What is love?

[Verse 2]
Tell myself I wouldn't cry when you're gone
But I know it's easier said than done
Look at me, look at me choked up now
Try to tell you but it won't come out

[Chorus 2]
What is love if you’re not here with me?
What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love if you're not here no more?
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love if it just ups and goes?

[Bridge]
I can’t live without ya (I can’t live without ya)
I can’t live with ya (I can’t live with ya)
What goes around will come right back around
You won't know 'til it hit ya
We were supposed to be
We were supposed to be
We were supposed to be an empire

[Chorus 2]
What is love if you’re not here with me?
What is love if it’s not guaranteed?
What is love if it just ups and leaves?
What is love
What is love if you’re not really sure?
What is love if it just ups

Okay

[Verse 1]
Why am I waking up out of my sleep
Thinking of ya babe
You had a hold on me
Now I'm feeling freer than I ever been
You been around love but you never been in

[Pre Hook]
Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray

[Hook]
I’ve been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way
I know that you hate it
But I’m freer than I’ve ever been
Something that you’ve never been

[Verse 2]
You had just what you needed to be
Everything you want to be
But you'd rather run round these streets
Now you're feeling freer than you've ever been
But really you feel trapped, no need to pretend

[Pre Hook]
Um, ay, running out of shit that I can say
Wishing you the best and so I pray

You don’t wanna touch nobody but me
Nobody

Saved, I’m hoping that you found a way
I’m moving around state to state
I’m living I know you can’t relate
Now I’m feeling freer than I’ve ever been
You know I was down
Now I’m on the fence
Ah, ay, a lot of bitches wanna ride the wave
Most of them was out to take your place
You done went and gave that shit away

I’ve been waiting for the day
You knew it was coming either way

Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

Tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er in the broad day
Hangin’ with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

But she a good girl

Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I keep my heart locked up in a safe, hey
Can't shoot with a pistol, need a K
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place

At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see I count that money like a nerdy
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

All I ever asked for was patience (That's all I ever asked and you know it)
Patience and pussy but mostly patience (Yeah, yeah 'cause you gon' use it anyway)
Swear I used to keep you faded

Me and my niggas bucking head first
You supposed to be there when my head hurt
Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party
Celebration on me, well what's up
Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real
Backwoods get peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous

[Intro: Anuel AA, Arcángel, J Balvin, Anuel AA & Ozuna]
Real hasta la muerte, ¿oíste, bebé? (Ah, ah-ah; ¡auh!)
Tú no quieres saber na' de mí (Uh, na-na)
Dime qué fue lo que yo hice mal (Dime qué pasó)
Te pusieron en contra de mí (Uh, na-na)
Pero es peor pedir perdón que perdonar
Se murió una flor (Flor), y cambió de color (Yeah-yeh)
Tú era' mi diabla y yo te daba calor
Fumando pa' olvidarte, pa' matar el dolor
Y a vece' quiero morirme, pero nadie ha muerto de amor (Huh)

[Coro: Ozuna, J Balvin, Arcángel, Ozuna & Anuel AA, *Ozuna & J Balvin*, *Ozuna, Arcángel & Anuel AA*, *Ozuna & Arcángel*]
Ahora dice que no me conoce, no-no-no-no-no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (Leggo)
Ahora dice que no me conoce, *no-no-no-no-no*
Y si me ha visto se supone *que en el pasado fue*
Yo sí me acuerdo cuando lo *hacíamos*
*Cuando en la cama nos matábamos*

[Verso 1: Anuel AA]
Te dejaste manipular, tú no sabes amar
Tú dice' que tú me odia', pero tú no me va' a olvidar
Tú sabe' que tu' pierna' yo te la' pongo a temblar
Yo te devoraba y tú empezaba' a gritar
Si se mueren, en la muerte traicionan
Te aman, se van y te odian
Y en la muerte es como a la' persona'
Que te dejan solo despué' que te lloran
Hablando con la luna como un lobo buscando a su loba
Buscando al demonio que te está devorando en su alcoba
Hablándote mal de mí como si yo ya me morí
Dile a ese infeliz que te la coma como yo te la comí
Y que te haga mojarte como yo te hice venirte
Tú dijiste que encima 'e mi cuerpo tú, ma', tú quería' morirte, eh

[Puente: J Balvin, J Balvin & Ozuna, Ozuna & Anuel AA]
Solo yo he podido llegarle
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban
No decías nada, no, no

[Pre-Coro: Ozuna & Arcángel]
Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
¿Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
"Yo no, no te conozco"? Pues, 'ta to' bien
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver
Solita, yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay, nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver
Porque dicen, y yo creo, que Lucifer es mujer

[Coro: Cardi B, Cardi B & Ozuna, Cardi B & Anuel AA]
Ahora dice que no me conoce, no-no-no-no-no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

You ain't cherish shit when you had it
Turn me back to a savage
Grab your stuff while you at it
Now my heart is cold as my Patek, uh
Man, I guess you feel away now
See me on the way up, you on your way down
You had you a ten, but now you a dub
You ain't here, but you wishing you was
You gon' miss grabbing this ass
Now you can miss me with them subs
You don't gotta check on me
'Ca-ca-cause I got a check on me
I don't need nothing from nobody
Not you especially
And-and you know that I'm the baddest
Cartier glasses, Fendi fabric
And I'm years away from basic
And I'm miles away from average, but
One thing ain't adding up to me
How you gon' mess with a bitch that look up to me?
Off'

[Verso 3: Offset]
I cannot let up (Let up)
Hug me like a Gucci sweater (Sweater)
Ain't nobody drippin' wetter (Drippin')
I took the time to write a letter (I took the time)
We worked hard out the ghetto
I don't deserve your heart, know you fed up (Nah)
We both had a broken heart when we met up (Eh)
Your body a piece of art, you don't sell it (Uh)
You know that I miss it, I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone, lookin' how we would kick it (Kick it)
Knock at the door, it's a visit (Huh)
She take that shit off then I fuck in the kitchen (Smash)
His and hers, Mr. and Mrs. (Hey)
When I talk to her baby girl listens (Listen)
I had a dream and you was in it (Dream)
When you gone, I feel like I been sinnin'
Come back, come back, come back (Come back)
You not really rich, got the bomb pack (Bomb)
Dive in the water, have fun with that (Dive)
I might put a daughter or son in that (I might)
I bought you a ring and five hundred racks (Hey)
She like the triangle Balenci bag (Drip)
You know you an angel, come save the bad (Angel)
If you really love me then take me back

[Pre-Coro: J Balvin & Ozuna]
J Balvin, man
Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
¿Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
"Yo no, no te conozco"? Pues, 'ta to' bien
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver
So-so-solita, yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay, nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver
Porque dicen, y yo creo, que Lucifer es mujer

[Coro: Arcángel, J Balvin & Ozuna, J Balvin & Anuel AA]
Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no-no-no-no-no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

You did many things
That I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne
You did many things

[Verse 1]
I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize, but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
On me
But I remember on the bathroom floor
'Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

[Verse 2]
Honey, please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in (we)
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

Night, midnight

[Verse 1]
Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

[Chorus]
We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?

Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain, hmm)

[Verse 1]
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

[Hook]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (Like tears in the rain)

Embrace all that comes (Embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (Alone you've become)
They all feel the same

[Verse 2]
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh

She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

Adjust to the fame (Adjust to the fame, and)

So now that she's gone (Oh, now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (Oh, embrace all that comes)

Don't show the world how alone you've become (I have nothing to show no more) (Oh, how alone I've become)
They all feel the same (Ooh, baby)
Adjust to the fame (Ohh, adjust to the fame, I ain't tryin' to be alone, baby)

I wanna know what made you stay
When it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin'
Where you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah

Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd prolly have one hundred wives (damn!)
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm iight, now she look like she surprised (I'm iight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime (Gucci!)

I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin

Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do

Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
What you waiting for?

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you coming)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed, butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about
Love had and love lost, here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat

[Verse 4: Joba]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you. mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you-u-u, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do

[Hook]
Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back

Spend my cash on my baby like

Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty

Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Intro]
Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard

This Off-White fit that I rock, shit permanent
Hmm, the fro that I grow got no perm in it
Hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed
Got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces
Parked the Lexus in the projects, bitch I'm reckless
Extra magazine hopped on a jet with my Ebony chick
Blacker than the Essence fest
The behind the back pass is so effortless
LeBron James to you Omaroses
Dapper Dan at 4AM, shit, I am the culture
I made my own waves so now they’re anti-Tidal
I’m livin' the no sock life to spite you
Since the Kalief doc, they've been at my neck
Y'all can tell 'em Trayvon is comin' next
The SEC, the FBI or the IRS
I pass the alphabet boys like an eye test

Stunt with your curls, your lips, Sarah Baartman hips
Gotta hop into my jeans like I hop into my whip yeah
Mobbin' in a hoodie like Melo
Come up out that pretty motherfucker like "Hello, Hello"
I will never let you shoot the nose off my Pharaoh
I like purple and purple rain
Tryin' to put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang
These people tryna get me out the paint
'Cause I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt
Man, we started with a mustard seed
Now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats
Sheesh! Matte black puma jet
Shining my light on the world just like "UMI Says"
Got the Richard Mille all colors
Might hit you with the Rose Gold all summer
For the culture
They even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up
I come from the finest crop
Tell em the god's on row, watch them line the block
The Chitlin' circuit is stopped
Now we in stadiums, Eighty Thou a wop, Watch

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, aye-uh

But my heart like gold, but it break like glass

Baby you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'mma give you some

Yeah the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
You way too drunk, you don't know what I'm saying
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night, I keep you waiting
You say you don't care, is what you saying

Okay, we be fighting, we be reuniting
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited

Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude

Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
To keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

Girl, just let your hair down
Let's paint the whole town
Life is our playground, yeah
But I'm not a kid no more
So I must open doors and make you feel like the lady you are
My momma raised me to be classy, not flashy
I'm happy to please you
Though I can tell that's not what you're used to

[Hook]
And they say chivalry is dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
Girl let a real man pick up the slack
And treat you with respect, yeah

And you don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
You don't have to love me
Love me, Love me
Just cause I'm a gentlemen don't mean
I ain't taking you to bed

[Verse 2]
Ahhh, baby let me buy your meals
I see your head over heels
I feel like you deserve it
There's no pressure
We can do whatever makes you comfortable, yeah
I could float your boat
If your cold take my coat
I'll Sing a music note from a song that I just wrote
Girl just take my hand
And let me be your man
Though that's not what your use to

I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, A$AP Rocky, and Frank Ocean]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and  A$AP Rocky]
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab
"I'm undone because"
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like
"I'm undone because"
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace

If I gotta be a bitch, I'ma be a bad one
I'm A.I. with the designs, du-ragging
Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven
They be tryna count me out though
I'm just countin', countin' blessins
A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Boy I really really came up
You never could say I'm lacking
All this shit I've been through
And it made me more of an assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion
And baby, if they askin'

Lit, lit, lit, lit, only L I take is to the face
You showed up to see me lose
But I overcome so you overcame
Basic, basic, ain't nothin' bout me basic
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, better watch what you say to me
'Cause Young Sway got the answers
Give 'em hell, give 'em pressure
VIP couch, no manners, dirty-dirty-dirty dancin'
Take a look at what I did, go for circle with the wrist
Whippin'-whippin' up the grits, get a handful of this nasty
I got it, I got it, I got it and you gon' respect it
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin'
Gon' stop me from makin' it happen
So baby, if they askin'

Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby, do it again, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel & Both]
You’re beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend

And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh, how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere

‘Cause it’s beautiful
Oh, you make me feel undressable
And I can’t pretend

[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen

[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)

[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

Maybe I'm not your speed
Maybe I'm out your league
You ain't even got no cheese
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Maybe I'm just too street
I can't even roll in peace
Everybody notice me
I can't even go to sleep
I'm rolling on a bean
They tried to give me eight got on my knees like, "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus

Most of us are angry
Most of us are strangely
More alike than we'd like to believe
Most of us are empty
Most of us are simply
More alive in the scenes of our dreams

[Chorus]
Then there's you
You've got something I've been wanting, oooh
You're so new
Oooh
You're my salvage, you're my balance, oooh
You're so new

Most of us are hurting
Most of us are searching
Someone to love
Someone to understand
Most the time I'm fighting
Multiple voices residing
In my head

Then there's you
You bring silence to my violent truth
Yes, you do
Oooh
You're my salvage, you're my balance, oooh

It hit me like a tidal wave
Knew that I was in love with you right away, yeah
Turned all my days into brighter days
Even when people say what we do is not okay
According to what the people say, yeah
Who cares what other people say?
Man, fuck what other people say
I'ma ride for you
Baby, if you gon' ride for me
Cause I know, yes I know
That what we have is oh so real
And oh I feel so confident in
All you say
When you say
You'll never leave
You'll never leave
Please never leave
Yeah, I believe you
Yes, I do

Most of all I am thankful
You are just what I prayed for
You are what I was made for
Yes, I'm for sure
Most of all
I just want to mean the most to you
Most of all, baby, I'm just tryna grow with you
I just wanna go with you
Cause you bring so much hope to the picture
Some of us do find the one
To fall in love
And off of the
Fucking face of the Earth with
Some of us do deserve it
A love that's true and perfect
Some of us been through it all before
Some of us do still come back for more

I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

[Verse 1]
They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be OK to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

[Interlude]
It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like"Yo, yo, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level--
Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not? Nigga"

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey

We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Beat em' like they stole some, beat em' like they stole some
All this booty here got 'em dreaming, lemme hold some
Let me, let me hear that boy, let me, let me wear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car, and let me steer that boy
Real big pretty titty, shut down every city
If you want the kid kitty, gotta get the key from me
All new everything, plus pay the rent for me
If we in the wilderness, niggas pitch the tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get me bodied
Long hair, no makeup, doing pilates
Those niggas don't step on my damn Zanottis
All them bitches my sons but who's the Daddy?
I graduate with honors, I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a freestyle, then I got a shout out from Obama
Yes, yes, I am ill, I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons, birth control, I am on the pill
What I gotta do? What I gotta do to 'em?
Step up in the club, everybody like who them?
Girls girls, me and my girls
What you done did? I need some referrals
Motherfuckers know I’m the shit, legit
And if a motherfucker don’t, he can suck my dick
I tell 'em, "Everybody else is my opposite!"
I put 'em on the game, give 'em five percent

[Chorus: Ciara]
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime

You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I’m like really famous, I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos, all this fame is heinous
Lemme, lemme hear that boy, lemme, lemme wear that boy
All this money coming in, but I never share that, boy
No lipstick, no lashes though
But I got a real big ol' ratchet, though
I said dude, yo dude, you packing dough
He said he want a good box like Pacquiao
I said, "Well, my name Nicki and it’s nice to meet you"
If you really wanna know, I’ll give you my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate wack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas
How you gon' break that? How you gon' fake that?
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake pops
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can’t keep up? They molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch, with the cashes flow
Looking at me like it’s my fault
Trying to take sneak pictures with they iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that’s what young Harriet died for

[Chorus: Ciara]
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here, mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye

And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home

The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari
And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

[Verse 2]
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 3]
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time

Pardon if I'm road raging

Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl, you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me, I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof

I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all, but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you cool
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?
Way I, way I, that's the way I think
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like
"Tight, let's keep it AMG"
Sliding down, precipitating is straight
Top down, let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on

Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're —"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase"
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh

[Verse 3: Akon]
Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my gold
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Intro]
American love, American me, American you
American tear, American heartbreak, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with

[Chorus]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law

[Verse 2]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy, fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"

[Chorus]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce

[Verse 3]
Well, you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh, if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do

Somebody real is hard to find
Somebody worth all your time
Somebody who can tell you the truth
Someone who loves you for you
Someone who knows all of your flaws, and
Doesn't impose, try to control them
Let's you be free, doesn't deceive
They give you a chance to believe, believe in something

[Pre-Chorus]
Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope
Is that too much? Is that too much?
Tryna find love in a world so cold
Oh, is that too much?
I just want an answer, I can't be the only one
Is that too much?
You ain't gotta be perfect
Just give me a purpose to love

[Chorus]
I just want somebody—body
To treat me like somebody—body
Won't be like everybody—body
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe

Won't be like everybody—body
All you gotta do is love me for me, babe

Now don't be mislead by the things that I've said
In the past I was young, I was looking for a thrill
That didn't last long, I was in it for the wrong
Wrong reason, wrong season, wrong person (yeah)
Cause he just wanted one thing and I just wanted something
To smile at and live for and hug on (ohh)
I'd rather have quality than quantity
Ohh, I just want someone that'll keep it real with me

Is that too much?
Cause I've been on the search and I'm losing my hope

Bouncin ass while I’m gettin' high as propellers on a helicopter

And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m lookin' good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
Over these pussy niggas, only under influence
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack
And a bucket but we nothin' but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough

Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement
Feelin' so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smokin' a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress

Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light

I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent

Only smile for you

Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away

See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Is this just a silly game (Silly game)
That forces you to act this way? (To act this way)
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working, no), it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (Oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)

[Verse 3]
I keep letting you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
See I know what we've got to do (Yeah)
You let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)
Cause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working), it ain't working (It ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, (This is crazy) Oh, this is crazy (This is crazy)

Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

[Outro]
This nigga—all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah—I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart

Take a dive inside this liquor
Got me pulling on your zipper

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Intro]
Oh yeah...
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing...
And all my people that's—

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man, man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer, I'm finna"
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2]
The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake
And "we don't care what people say," my niggas

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 3]
You know the kids' gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park", see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare, they tryna put me on the school bus
With the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But "we don't care what people say," my niggas

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out yo name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a Bimmer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it (Not make it)
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, "It's different strokes for different folks"
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her, "You don't gotta make it difficult"
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it (Not make it)
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

I might not make it, oh no I might not make it

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't "How To Be A Player," you ain't Bill Bellamy

[Pre-Chorus]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, "Who is this?"
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, ooh

Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya

What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alright

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I...)
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (Oh, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Hey love, I lost you babe
Picking up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said
(To come clean is to come clean)
To be real is to be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been dropping out and
I've been hanging out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention, now
(Much too cool for 7th grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again

[Chorus 1]
Damn Gina, damn Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight mama
You need some get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go get that get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go 'til you get right mama

I belong to nobody, hope it don't bother you
You could mind your business
I belong to nobody, try not to disturb or
Mind my business

Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no

Still works for me, it works for me, no

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach

Enough is enough

[Intro: Sech]
This is the remix
Tiene a to' el mundo buscándola
Dice que en mi casa está secuestra'
Un vídeo en mi cama esposándola (Ice)
Dice que aquí se quiere quedar

[Pre-Coro: Lenny Tavárez]
69 posiciones y la dejo
Yo lo sé, cogemos como conejo'
Y eso es lo que a mí me corre de ti
Que se muerda, que estoy puesto pa' ti, déjale saber

[Puente: Dalex]
Yo no puedo compartirte
Eres como la clave de mi celular (Yeah)
No es necesario decirte que

[Coro: Dalex & Lenny Tavárez]
Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Con nadie)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)
Y él como loco anda buscándote (Buscándote)
Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Eh-eh)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)
Y él como loco anda buscándote (Buscándote)

[Verso 1: Sech]
Te quiero pa' hacerte feliz enseguida
Hagamos un trío, tú y yo y to'a la vida
Que no te tenga en Insta no es que no te siga (Siga)
Te quiero pa' mí, no importa lo que digan
Todos (Todos), a veces me enojo
Dime qué ves ya que tú eres mis ojos
Hablando claro, de la forty me despojo
Pero dile' que están vivos, por vivo' y no por flojo'

[Verso 2: Lenny Tavárez]
Caras vemos, corazones no sabemo'
Pero a ti te conozco hasta el pelo (Hasta el pelo)
Ai, se eu te pego, flow Michel Teló (Teló)
Tú querías bellaquear, pues, melo (Melo)

[Pre-Coro: Lenny Tavárez]
69 posiciones y la dejo (Y la dejo)
Yo lo sé, cogemos como conejo'

Que se muerda, que estoy puesto pa' ti

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Nadie)

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solito pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Eh-eh)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)
Y como loca anda buscándote (Buscándote)

[Verso 3: Cazzu]
No te confunda' con mi flow, Rosario Tijeras
Que por más que parezco mala, no estoy pa' cualquiera
No soy la más que le mete ni tampoco la más bonita
Pero le gustó el piquete, el flow de esta mamacita
Ni Gucci ni Prada, ningún Louis Vuitton
No quiero na' de eso, pon tu habitación
Vo'a llevarte preso en mi peli de acción
Va' a sentirme en tus beso' y en tu corazón
Bebé, ¿quién era esa que te causó tanta tristeza?
Te llena de duda', te da dolor de cabeza
Si pelea' conmigo, lo resolvemo' en la pieza
Y si no llegamo', lo hacemo' encima 'e la mesa

[Verso 4: Dalex & Rafa Pabön]
Y ah, Y ah-Y ah-Y ah, Y ah-Y ah-Y ah-, Y ah
Y ahora yo soy el que te lo pone a ti sin condone'
Y él ya no lo puede evitar
Y si le duele, que la abandone
A mí sin cojone', porque no te supo cuidar
Baby, sólo apaga tu teléfono
Ponte la Balenciaga, dale, vámono'
Cojamo' carretera y perdámono'
Y como caníbales má' comámono'

[Coro: Dalex]
Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Nadie)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)
Y él como loco anda buscándote (Buscándote)
Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Eh-eh)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)
Y él como loco anda buscándote

[Verso 5: Feid]
Así como suena, yeh
¿Cómo estás? Yo te quiero pa' mí, pero en la lenta
Como me calientas, como tú te sueltas
Entiende que tú eres mía y no te voy a prestar, yeh
Sígueme que yo te sigo
Llegando a Medellín te entrego el anillo
Y al pirobo de tu novio, yo me lo vacilo
Y a las otras les picheo porque estoy contigo, yeh

[Verso 6: Rafa Pabön]
Que te siga buscando que él no te va a encontrar
Ahora está' conmigo, ya él no te va a tocar
Y que no trate de forzar porque le puede costar
Y aunque no tenga sueño, lo podemo' acostar
Esto es sin hablar, porque no soy de roncar
Pero tú eres mía, lo tiene' que aceptar
Que ahora conmigo es que vas a despertar
Y solamente él te puede imaginar

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Nadie)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)

Yo te quiero pa' mí, no te quiero pa' más nadie
Solita pa' mí, no te comparto con nadie (Eh-eh)
A mano armada fue que te robé (Te robé)

Como un loco él te anda buscando
No se da cuenta que estás picheándolo
Siempre que te llama, está' ignorándolo
Porque está' conmigo, nena, díselo
Díselo, que tú a mí me quiere'
Que él ya se jodió, por otras mujere'
No vas a volver por más que te espere
Y ahora yo soy al que tú prefiere' (Eh, eh, eh)

I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn(take out)
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO

I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't runnin' games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby I love you”
If you ain't runnin' games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby

Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah ok" (Uh huh, ok)
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say (Let me say)
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, if I'm the girl that you claim (Claim)
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

[Pre-Chorus: Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange

'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce (Bounce)
When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house
(The house)
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie? (Feel, lie)
Gettin' caught up in your game, when you cannot say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
And I say "Well, goddamn"

Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?

This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.

And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d met you once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be your child if you insist
I mean if it was you that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I’m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this

[Intro : Maître Gims]
Insensé, insensible, tu l'aimes mais pourtant tu la fuis
Insensé, insensible, tu l'aimes mais pourtant tu la fuis

[Couplet 1 : Doomams]
Pardonne-moi pour tes insomnies à répétitions
Pardonne-moi pour les files d'attentes, les clashs à l'inspection
Pardonne-moi pour les garde-à-vue, les perquisitions
Pardonne-moi d'être parti si tôt d'être devenu musicien
Toutes les fois où j'ai oublié de répondre à tes messages
Toutes les fois où je devais venir te voir entre deux-trois dates
Toutes les fois où j'ai du te mentir pour éviter que tu me frappes
Toutes ces fois, je n'ai jamais douté de ta bonne foi

[Couplet 2 : Maska]
Ta mère est une fleur rare que t’abreuves par ton amour
L'en priver c'est la tuer donc n’abrège pas son compte à rebours
Dis-lui qu'tu l'aimes, que tu regrettes ta manière d'être conflictuelle
Elle a du mal à s'évader car tes grands frères ont pris du ferme
Est-ce mes rides qui m'empêchent de lui sourire ?
J'veux pas rester en vie jusqu'à la voir mourir
Tes larmes piquaient mes plaies, j'aimerais te contenter
À jamais, je maudis ce jour où on t'enterre

[Refrain : Maître Gims]
Et même quand tout le monde est contre toi, elle reste ta meilleure amie
T'aimerais lui dire ce qu'elle représente pour toi avant qu'elle ne perde la vie
Mais tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et même quand tout le monde est contre toi, elle reste ta meilleure amie
T'aimerais lui dire ce qu'elle représente pour toi avant qu'elle ne perde la vie
Mais tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire

[Couplet 3 : Black M]
J'suis sûr qu'elle aimerait juste entendre un "Maman je t'aime"
A la place des cris du daron qui menace de te jeter
J'suis sûr qu'elle craque au bout d'une semaine passée sans toi
Et que ton absence lui ferais plus mal qu'une chute du haut de son toit
J'suis sûr qu'elle aimerait que tu la prennes dans tes bras
Exactement comme elle le faisait durant tes 12 premiers mois
J'suis sûr que l'amour t'as rendu myope
Au lieu de le porter à ta mère tu le portes à une idiote

[Couplet 4 : Barack Adama & Lefa]
Des heures au phone avec ta meuf afin de mieux vous rapprocher
Quand ta mère t'appelle tu veux vite raccrocher
Devant tes potes tu lui tiens tête tu veux lui donner des leçons
Mais t'oublies que cette tête elle l'a tenue quand elle te donnais le sein
Crois-moi sur parole
On peut remplacer des poumons mais surement pas une daronne
T'as habité en elle, t'as habité sous son toit
C'est la seule personne qui prie pour quitter ce monde avant toi
Au commissariat pour elle t'étais jamais coupable
Mais pour moi tu l'es car t'es bronzé alors qu'elle est toute pâle
À part elle, personne supporte ton égoïsme permanent
T'es pas le nombril du monde mais t'es celui de ta maman

[Refrain : Maître Gims]
Et même quand tout le monde est contre toi, elle reste ta meilleure amie
T'aimerais lui dire ce qu'elle représente pour toi avant qu'elle ne perde la vie
Mais tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et même quand tout le monde est contre toi, elle reste ta meilleure amie
T'aimerais lui dire ce qu'elle représente pour toi avant qu'elle ne perde la vie
Mais tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire
Et tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas, tu n'oses pas lui dire

[Couplet 5 : Maître Gims]
Je ne suis jamais parti
Je n'ai jamais changé
Si ce n'est ma voix et ma taille
Oh Maman, c'est moi
Je veux que tu valides ma fiancée
Réconforte-moi comme quand je tombais
Maman ou t'es passé
Oh, regarde-moi

[Couplet 6 : JR O Crom]
Simplement t'serrer dans mes bras
T'serrer très fort te dire je t'aime une dernière fois, repose en paix
Pour nous, t'as donné corps et âme, si j'ai plus d'encre tant pis je continuerai avec mes larmes, akhi
Aujourd'hui, Maman n'est plus là
J'suis tombé d'haut mais j'pourrais pas tomber plus bas
Poto, joue pas l'enfant d'la DDASS
Si t'en as une, fais-lui plaisir : dis-lui qu'tu l'aimes avant qu'elle parte

[Outro : JR O Crom]
À tous ceux qui ont encore une mère
Même si la mort n'arrête pas l'amour
Dites-leur que vous les aimez
Avant qu'elles partent

With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever

You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

Will never come in between

When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Because

If I weren't in this spider web of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives

Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
‘Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
‘Cause now they know you are love of my life

But I cannot promise I won’t run up in the church there screamin’ your name Bambi
No one can take you from me Bambi

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me back out
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now
Huh?

She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga
Takin' niggas bitches back to back, yeah I'm that nigga
A-Boogie on her titty, took my autograph with her
Whoever she goin' home to, I feel bad for that nigga
He gon' be a mad nigga

Bitches be for everybody, nigga why you trippin' 'bout it
Fuck a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it

Fucked a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it

Take my phone, search what you want
"Who's this bitch?" "Girl that's my mom"
"Who's this woman?" "Girl that's my aunt"

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
I've tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (boom)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin' to herself, "Damn this verse real"
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one

[Verse 3: Chris Brown  & Rick Ross]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm... (May-May-May)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know (gotta love it, baby, uh) (May-May-May)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (uh)
Sayin', "Sorry", layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (boss)
The red bottoms got you walkin' funny (ha)
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
Yeah, I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock (May-May)
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right (May-May-May)

Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me
Can't show my face if you spit for me

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats, I make tracks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo; I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got
Oh, baby, hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3: Pras with Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly!)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border, like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Wyclef)]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

Pussy wet and dripping, I feel like sipping

Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(Ayy, come here, man, haha)
Ooh
(Señorita, she is beautiful, no?)
We The Best Music (Oh-nah-nah)
Sabes bien que fue un engaño (Oh-nah-nah)
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado (Another one)

Why, oh why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

[Outro: J Balvin, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh, you stay
Tell me why you (Another one)
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillian me dan luz solo que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
Think you're too loyal

Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)

Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

Every time she do it it's for me and my niggas

Go on kiss her, go on, go on Kiss her (go on Kiss her)
She don't even like girls

If it get any bigger baby girl gon' have to tow it
Sitting on them M's like Floyd
But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama (Si!), bonita (Si!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Hey)
You make a woman go mad (Yeah)
So be wise (Si!) and keep on (Si!)
Reading the signs of my body (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Uh-huh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow

But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let him think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call, my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (what I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (not even close)
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!

Ohh, I be ridin' 'round with my seat reclinin'
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true ballin' on these bum whores
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it!)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat (snack)

Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss)

'Cause I've been already gone, baby

We all have obsessions, oh, sometimes, sometimes

'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (Check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (We flexin')

Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (Yeah)

Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (The Dalai Lama)
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)
Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever

Tell me baby if I fuck you right, can I fuck forever?
Tell me should a real nigga feel this way
Tell me doesn't anyone feel this way

[Verse 1]
I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

[Pre-hook]
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

[Hook]
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

[Verse 2]
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets

Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame

Hey, your love is so amazing
It's all I want, got a nigga faded
Shawty on fire, and she really blazin'
Flames Armageddon, yelling, "Jesus save me"
I'ma take her soul if she try to play me
'Cause that's all mine, that's my lil' baby
I'm in all white, like the fucking eighties
Throwing up the Roc', like a nigga Jay-Z

[Intro: Fabolous]
You see, what I can't understand
Is how somebody have a life-time friend
Who they've been through thick and thin with
And they just fall out over the simplest shit, man
But that same person will be in a relationship with a triflin ass mo'fucka
But they keep taking them back!
Shit is crazy...

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
The Karma of fucking over a good person
Is the asshole you end up wit'
Get a taste of your own medicine
Funny, you the one who end up sick
Always took you back, even though it made my friends upset
Told me I should blow you off, haven’t got that wind up yet
Know how many days I hurt? Many nights I’ve been up stressed?
Thought that we had been in love, maybe I just been obsessed
When you crossed me, you lost me
Now if I was guardin' Derrick Rose
I would be more understandin' but you ain't Derrick Rose
You was my number one, but uuuhmm, you ain't Derrick Rose
You try to make a point again, you ain’t Derrick Rose
You just on some bullshit, bitch, you ain’t Derrick Rose
I’m a lover and a fighter, fight for what I love
But you made something of bitches I think nuttin' of
Ask myself why I fight when it’s long been over
God gives the hardest battles to the strongest soldiers
So I fight for us, long as there's reason to
You wanted to give up on us long as there is season two
Cool, you’re gonna need me one day
And if it’s Sunday, that one day gon' be Monday
That’s how fast things change sometimes
Niggas play the tough role, I Ving Rhames sometimes
Like, like, like I don't want that bitch back
I mean, I want her, but I don’t want the bitch back
She say she want him, but she don’t want that nigga back
That nigga act like I ain’t had a nigga back

[Chorus: Sample]
You’re gonna need me someday
You’re gonna want me back in your heart

[Interlude: Joe Budden]
So much pain in this sample
So much pain in some of our hearts
I just want a pain-free heart
I don't ask for much
Fab, what's good though
Let's talk to her real quick...

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Let me start with ‘I love you’, and I think we got the power to grow
Woulda gave up, but ain’t no coward in Joe
Funny thing about it all, you checked my Twitter every hour or so
And then you bring this fake shit to our reality show
Spent however many years looking for devotion, it’s weird
Your feelings but I put 'em into motion
I dictate the what’s and why’s (what else?), the how and when
You ain’t learn to separate your now from then
I keep my distance, when I’m near my head is hurting
Exhausted every road to friendship, but it's never working
Me, I met the sweetest girl, you know y'all met in person
Bottom line, I made you then made a better version
Tried to give you good advice, but you ain’t heed it
Must’ve figured you ain’t need it, but all I can do is seed it
Told you you gon' fuck around and end up sick
You chose dick from this nigga off the New York Knicks
My Nig... you so spiteful, that ain’t the way we act
That cock was inserted in you, how could it pay me back?
I know you said when we were over you'd start aiming bigger
But you can’t have anonymity with famous niggas
Know you thinking my happiness is a front
How would you ever know? Happiness is what you wanted
So unidentifiable when that harm'll never let up (why?)
You fucked me real good, karma fucked you better

[Chorus: Sample]
You’re gonna need me someday
You’re gonna want me back in your heart

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
You never miss a good thing till it leave you
Finally I realize I don’t need you
You want me back, you know you’re gonna need me back
Gotta have me back, yeah
Heartbroken when you left my world
Boy, you know you should’ve kept this girl, I was there for you
Now I don’t know what you gonna do without me, baby
That was the last thing I said to you
I notice you know its dead end with you

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
You’re gonna want me back, you’re gonna want me back
You’re gonna want me back
You’re gonna need me one day
You’re gonna want me back in your heart

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, "Hi"? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don’t have much longer baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

Someone who’s true and kind
Kind in every way like
To my body, to my mind

That I’m all you need
Is it true?
That you are the one for me
Is it true?
When you are with her

You be missing me

I turn your world around and upside down
You got me now

Everybody’s like girl don’t trip
You the only one he been with
He don’t even really commit like that
I ain’t never seen him with no other chick like that
So tell me how you feel
Cause I can’t read yo mind
Wanna know what you been thinking
And what you feel inside

[Chorus]
Is it true?
That I’m all you need
Is it true?
That you are the one for me
Is it true?
Cause I’ve been imagining
The beauty in what life could be
Is it true?
I wanna know
Is it true?
Are you serious?
Do you feel the way I do?
Are you into me like I’m into you?

I really like what you’ve done to me

You’re young, you’re fine, so magnificent
Go on girl, yeah just keep killing it
Your body like an orange and I am peeling it
The way I am feeling there’s no concealing it
And that’s why I, I, I am really feeling it so

[Chorus: Ayo Jay]
Can I get your number girl?

Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love

Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We never been this far from the shore
We might not ever go back anymore
Got you all in your emotions, hit you with the force then
Tell me your desires, I won't ever tire

Up and down motion, come swim in my ocean, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I brought my sand to the beach
Hopped out the Lam' with the sheep
Skin rugs on the floor
We hugged, made love on the seats
We tried to hide in the hills
We watched the sky turn peach
Summer's light like, summer's night
It's like, Christ masterpiece
She taste like Corona Light, sweet
Even the lime gotta squeeze
She gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed
If I can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
I don't have no concept of time
Even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects
Bullet rounds interrupting my Chi
When the worst thing that could happen
Zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
In Bel-Air, only the nights get cold
I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Oh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I need to take my time to show you somethin' real (so real)
This is real (so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel, how I feel
Let's make love in the summertime
Let's make love in the summertime
Be in each other's arms
Let it breathe, let it breathe
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To love in each other's arms, yeah

That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you please

She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want

Diana walked up to me, she said I'm all yours tonight

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said, said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, you know I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck, baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah, ooh Lord

Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life, uh
Little life, little lie, oh yeah
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
'Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute

Secure the bag so we can take a trip to Italy
I know I’m a pain so I’m confused to why you into me
I guess this is love and I’m certain that it is
I see you got baby fever, one day we should have some kids
We in love, why we fighting? We just need to face it
It’s a marathon, you last longer when you pace it
I just want you to know I just want us to grow
When we be fightin’ I feel so low, though
Are we gon’ last? I don’t know no more, I don’t know no more
Put your foot on the gas, fuck a stop sign, go (Yeah)
I think we thinking too much, let’s just go with the flow

Last verse was before the breakup
Still wondering if we gon' make up
Can't sleep girl, nah, I gotta stay up
I miss the nights when we used to cake up
Used to text "good morning," now I get a "GM"
Washed up rappers in your fuckin’ DM
Still wondering if you went to see him
Stayed out 'til the morning, after fuckin' PM
You got back in the morning, I'm talkin' 6 in the morning
Our connection got boring
You gon’ make me glo up and go and cop me a foreign
You been sleepin’ on me lately, girl, it sound like you snoring (Yeah)
Used to be my baby, now I call you my ex
Them basketball players only want you for sex
Them internet niggas look at you as a check
Girl, I loved your ass to death, treated you with respect
Took you to the islands, girl, that came from the heart
I ain't really feel the love, I was doing my part
It's a whole list of shit, I don't know where to start
Go and find another man, girl, you cute and you smart

Don't worry, I'll be back for you
All the money and cars, stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean, reflecting on all you see
(This is all, this is all)

[Verse 2]
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (This is all)
Bought the mansion on foreclose (This is all)
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope (Ooh)
Some shit only me and the Lord knows (Ooh)
SOS is for those who hear this in morse code (Ooh)
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads (Ooh)
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes (This is all)
This shit'll have you in divorce court (Ooh)
Fighting over your seeds
Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)
Alimony and fees (Ooh)
As your lawyer proceeds (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
To give out bad news

[Chorus 1]
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean anything in between
(This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line, yeah (This is all)

[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say, "When we married"
'cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed
Talk nasty for your boy, silent treatment for the feds

Feel that? (I feel that) That's that love comin' down

Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice

You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round

Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down

That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down

You shut it down

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

You shut that thing down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down (down, down, down)

You shut it, ohh

You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice

Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round

They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
What did I do to deserve you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear, but we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it

I don't think they know the truth (Say it ain't so), say it ain't so
I don't think they know (I don't think they—), how could they know?

What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me (Yeah)
I think you want some more (Oh)
I do more than sing
I model now, acting now (Ooh, yeah)
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more (Need some more, babe)
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do (Ooh, whoa)
Oh-whoa

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it, whoa?

Oh baby, ooh, yeah (You gotta rock away to this one)
You will always be my boo

Girl, I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)

I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)

You will always be my boo

Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin’
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong (That’s right)
You did me wrong, oh, oh, ayy

All by my side
Argue, let's talk, I need you by my side
You had my back when the gang used to slide
Now you gone tell me you done with my time
I thought that I needed you in my life
All of them times that you talked, but you lied
Girl, you was down and you told me you roll like my Rollie
I'm done 'cause you lie with my guys, like nah
The only plan was to ball
Remember them times when we fall, but we got up and fought
I tried to leave, you would stall
Baby, I gave you my all, my all, my all
No car, we rode in the backseat
Yeah, you used to ride like a taxi
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea

Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there

[Chorus 1]
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

[Verse]
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Chorus 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain

Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to stop it yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)

You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 1: Ray J]
I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG
Me and ghost sittin' clean with the matching rollie
I did that first so everybody know me

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work

I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Steady on at the top where we finna be
Apple juice and we mix it with the Hennessy
Give her no dough to come, but I gave her 10 to leave
I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity
First come, first served is all a player know
But I don't wanna be a player no more
That's a lie, I'm way too fly
I love anything with ass that walk by
Yeah you love her, yeah you hug her and you kiss her
She dome me up, she give me face like some whiskers
Tia’s and Tamera’s, I be knockin sisters
And I still hit, while you lonely and you miss her

[Bridge: Ray J]
When I walk in the function
You already know I'm leaving with something
Girls know when I'm coming
I give a girl real proper loving

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first
I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

[Verse 3: Ray J]
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I know just how you'd do me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I know just why you'd choose me
And if you were to come back to me
Girl, I'll get it wet -- jacuzzi
And if you were to come back to me girl
We'll make another movie

[Chorus: Ray J]
She might move on to rappers and ballplayers
But we all know I hit it first
I hop in the club and boppers show love, and I don't even put in work

[Intro]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums

[Estribillo]
Dímelo, si el cabrón no vale la pena, no vale la pena
Vamo', ma', confiésalo (Confiésalo)
Y lo borramo' de la escena, borramo' de la escena
Vamo', mami, dímelo
Si el cabrón no vale la pena, no vale la pena
Vamo', ma', confiésalo
Y lo borramo' de la escena, borramo' de la escena

[Verso 1]
La cosa e' muy simple, le' voy a contar
Ella tiene un pibe que no' molesta
No sé si es el ex o el de ahora
Pero eso no importa, conmigo ella está (Ey)
Por eso salimos encapucha'os
Yo soy en verdá' el que la tiene mal
El otro no' vive buscando
Parece que comió la peli de Slenderman
No sé qué más, no sé qué más
Odiamos el día y la noche na'
Es una vampira y yo Drácula
Pasamo' la vida en la oscuridá'
Solamente nos pasamos el rato pensando en como salir sin que nos vean
Y es que lo' bocone' que molestan se quedan en la casita viendo novelas

Ay-ay-ay (¡Wuh!)

[Verse 1]
Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, "Is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?"
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not "we"
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
"No justice, no peace," okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, "Black Lives Matter," but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9
Takes another child's life on sight

[Hook]
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free

[Interlude 1]

[Macklemore, speaking over voices]
"Oh, what are you doing Ben? What are you doing here?"

[Various indistinct male voices]
"Probably shouldn't be here, you have white supremacy, don't fuckin' come here. — Culture Vulture! — ('Black Lives Matter,' say it.) — Wow. — ('Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.') — You should not have done that. Why the fuck would you do that? — (What are you doing here?) — You always react. Just let it go, man. — White racist. — It's the Grammys!"

[Macklemore]
"Ben, think about it."

[Verse 2]
You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, "Rest in peace, Mike Brown"
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention? What's the intention?

[Interlude 2: Protesters]
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"

[Verse 3]
"Pssst, I totally get it, you're by yourself
And the last thing you want to do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you
She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags'
I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even the old mom like me likes it, cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool"
Yeah?
"Yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb
If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run"
Huh?

[Interlude 3: Various male and female voices]
"So, they feel that the police are discriminating against the... the black people? — I have an advantage? Why? Cause I'm white? (laughs) What? (laughs) No. — See, more people nowadays are just pussies. Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything. — 'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights. — I'm not prejudiced, I just... — 99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly."

[Verse 4]
Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
Then I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The DIY underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?

[Interlude 4: Various male and female voices]
"Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. — My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. — The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. — I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'"

[Outro: Jamila Woods]
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free

[Verse 4: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe it's not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burping
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I loaded my clip in and told her, "Don't get nervous"
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy Bang, bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker, ball like a dribble
Put you in a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much? I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you) then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen ass, I need a 3D

Can we get a room
And we ain't gotta tell nobody
It's just me, and it's just you
And what we do in here is private
Cut your phone off
Make sure the door is locked
It's midnight gotta leave out by 4 o'clock
Sneaking and freaking it's Friday the weekend
I'm just getting started I don't wanna leave you
I tell you I love you, you know that I mean it
You beating it up and I'm bobbing and weaving
We fucking all night to the morning and evening
Gotta lay pipe until we get even

I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Hook]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)

[Verse 2: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me déjà vu
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better (Better, baby)
No more tryna make it work, hey (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)

Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye), deuces

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying (Hee)

Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders

Pick pocking on the corner

In my mailbox, there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said see you later

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already

Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

[Verse 2: Drake]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already

Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

[Verse 4: Drake]
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

[Verse 1: Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards and Jess Glynne]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My mama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A woman)

[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall and Jess Glynne]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, ayy, ayy
You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it

'Yoncé with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards and Jess Glynne]
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My mama always said, "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy, you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
(A woman)

[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall and Jess Glynne]
Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (a woman)

La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, woman like me, yes a woman like me (oh)
Soon as I brush up on him I could tell he like me (oh)
You know all them mandem, a try to swipe me (kyuh)
Knotted up, he could afford to ice me (Hh, rhrr)
Tell 'em there's a bad Trini bitch inna your area (uh)
But the more bad bitches, then the more merrier (c'mon)
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier (uh)
Rude boy, tell me, can you handle all this derrière? (da derrière, rhrr)
Uh, a million I'm getting my billy on
Greatest of all time, 'cause I'm a chameleon
I switch it up for every era, I'm really bomb
These bitches really wanna be Nicki, I'm really mom (uh)
Apple cut the cheque, I want all this money
Seven Up, go grip the TEC, and leave all this bloody
I-It's the Queen and Little Mix, skated on 'em, sorry
My daddy is Indian (Swish), a-all this curry (Mhm)

But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I’m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Throw my dress shoes in a fire with the woods
Sit back and relax with the fumes of everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Sun sets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four sil
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, uh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two-liter, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft shell tacos
Right after pennies and ramen noodles
Now I see how I'm gon' make a shooter
Stamina, stamina!
I used to be holding the camera
Head through the glass, throw your window up
Start praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang but I feel like Santana
Sweet talkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-a
She can't eat 'cause she's so Bella
Confused erection
Bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless

You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said "Oel ngati kameie"

I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom

[Hook: The Weeknd]
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile

All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

Fuck her like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari
Old money, I just 'fraid the Lord with us
Condo blow money, like it's all dope money
Come short wet niggas, like a speed boat coming, oh Lord
Mo money, mo money, these rich young niggas ain't ever know money
Belaire running down the Rollie on her arm
Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it
I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield
Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib
25 mil, I'm doing 25-to-life
100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night
Every chandelier ran a nigga, one-mil
20 chandeliers motherfucker who real
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Birkin, now she in the Bentley
That's when she went and tatted double M G
Now our bond deep, deeper than the rap
She give me brain she a mastermind to be exact
She a mastermind to be exact
I give her game and she give it back
Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind 'till your eyes close,
Stay strapped 'till the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dawgs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off
What make it worse he get an elbows
25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone

Fall back when you don't deserve it
And I'll start losin' patience
When my effort's bein' wasted
I've been tryna ride
Can't you see I'm on your side?
But it's killin' me
Tryna make sure that both of us survive
And love, I haven't got enough practice
All the ones before you were just a mistake
Or just a distraction
So tell me what's happenin'

So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea- brea

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast

Part 1: Ghost

[Intro: Young Beyoncé & (Presenter)]
(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

Part 2: Haunted

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

That ain't my, that ain't my girl, that's my nigga
Catch me out on Ocean Drive wit' her
Aye, catch me in the whip ridin' wit' her
Hey, sippin' somethin', bumpin' BIG "Hypnotize" wit' her
Pray you get that job in Tampa
That's only 4 hours away
Take a car, take a plane
Baby, whichever is faster
Uh, whichever one isn't a hassle
Aw damn yeah, uh, ho
Never knew no I never knew
That, you'd be a freak and a friend too, yeah
You into everything I'm into, ho

A piece of mind, baby come and get a piece of mine, chea
Say you gotta work from 3 to 9, oh
I'll get you home by a decent time
Wait, fuck yo' bed you can sleep in mine, yeah
Let's make it happen girl I need some time
Speakin' of time, who stopped it?
That's the feelin' that I get when we lock lips
I got the weed at the crib, and the liquor too
I fuck your soul out, releasin' your spiritual
I'll be yo' muse, bring your easel and pencils, too
Here you go, you tryna' tease wit' them pictures
You can ride on me, just like you ride the elliptical
She said, "I'm tryna' keep it tight for my nigga'"
Girl unlike your last nigga', all I need is mental
You know I'll work you out, get you right wit' your physical

Oh it's just another interlude
Askin' all them questions
Girl you know I don't do interviews
It's pitiful that when I'm wit' them other bitches I pretend it's you

[Verse 2]
Oh, you work at Kohl's, you in Dental school
Wifin' now, you foldin' clothes, cookin' dinner too
Young Tiller, girl I'm known as Pen Griffey too
It's only right that I swing by and hit it too
First base, second base, third base
I'm tryna' get you in your birthday (suit) ho

But please never entertain ‘em cause' that would hurt me

You feel me, yeah

Ahhhh, too lit for this shit right now
Too busy for this shit right now

Here we go, yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like "Billie Jean", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G

[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Here we go again

[Verse 1: SZA]
Ripping the heads off all my Barbie dolls
Toss them to the side, get the convertibles
(Click, vroom) I like the way it rides up
Ken had it all, Skipper wanted more than
Watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
She wish that she had it

[Chorus: SZA]
Here in your backyard, building a fantasy
Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me
Do you want to know me?

[Verse 2: SZA]
Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller
Street Fighters and such
I yelled "finish him"
(Down goes Frazier)
I yelled "finish him"
Come Desdemona, Othello and tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows, where do I begin?
Where do we begin?

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute, for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
Wins on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower, take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till Peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was

[Outro: SZA & Chance the Rapper]
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Here in your backyard, building a fantasy)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
(Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me)
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Do you want to know me?)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in line
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

Looks like God's on my side, this time
Well, I been meanin' to tell ya
You lookin' better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather
Feel much better when that weather isn't rain, yeah
Ooh Cinderella, don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been taking all day
Wherever you came from, wherever you going
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away
I been meanin' to tell ya
You look better every day, write you letters
It's only right that right after love, I write my name

But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up

Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping

Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you

Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk

Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

[Verse 1]
You been picking my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
Cuz I ain't scared of the fall

[Verse 2]
Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"

[Hook]
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel

[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it

Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww

As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

[Chorus]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting

So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no

[Intro]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 1]
Straight up ahead, you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing
About how I feel about you and all those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell
Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have, brightness gone
So dark without you, girl

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 2]
Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self-worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas of the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy-ending-princess me
Processing the information transferred from your mind to me
At light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me when I was six and no worries
Would stop me from reaching the stars
A million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
Like a plague hitting my body except if I fall, I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge, alterations are acknowledged
And the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun
Wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy, at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me
This emotion will be gone before you know

[Outro]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmm
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
About this heart and all its breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmm
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh

I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
I can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy & 2Pac]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try
It's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Everytime I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it

Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, “Thank you”
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches “BJ”
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (My name)
My name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want-want-want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much

Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your head
The violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times, I’m starting to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind, without you, I’m out it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

What the heart wants

What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby

Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan, he'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And, I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...

Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way, just got in town

Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder, would you just

Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through

Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb

[Couplet 1]
Aujourd'hui, je suis fatigué, je t'ai regardé dormir
Et si ma voix peut t'apaiser, je chanterai pour toi toute la nuit
Je t'entends dire à tes pines-co : "Dadju, j'peux plus m'passer de lui"
Hey, tout va glisser sur ta peau, c'est comme si je te passais de l'huile
Et s'ils ne sont pas nous, c'est tant pis pour eux
Et s'ils sont jaloux, c'est tant pis pour eux
Fais-le moi savoir quand c'est douloureux
Je suis là s'il faut encaisser pour nous deux

[Refrain]
Et je le sais, je te fais confiance
Quand tu me souris, tu fais pas semblant
J'ai pas besoin d'attendre plus longtemps
Je sais qu'il est temps d'partager mon sang
Et t'élever au rang de reine
Au rang de reine, au rang de reine
J'vais t'élever au rang de reine
Au rang de reine, au rang de reine
Oh oh ah

[Couplet 2]
Je sais que l'amour c'est compliqué, mais, avec toi, c'est plus facile
Continue de rester toi-même et je ne regrette pas de t'avoir choisi
Je l'ai promis à ton papa, je vais prendre soin de sa fille
Tu fais partie de ma famille et Dieu sait combien j'aime ma famille
Et s'ils te demandent, c'est qu'ils sont curieux
S'ils te redemandent, c'est qu'ils sont envieux
Ferme la porte à ceux qui font de leur mieux
Pour nous empêcher d'être deux quand on sera vieux

Et je le sais, je te fais confiance
Quand tu me souris, tu fais pas semblant
J'ai pas besoin d'attendre plus longtemps

Assez parlé, au bout d'un moment, y a plus les mots
Ça y est, j'ai délaissé mon cœur dans ta paume
J'te laisserai pas t'en aller, c'est mort, j'ai mis du temps à te trouver, mi amor
Celui qui dit qu'on s'est trompé a tort, on se battra même contre les coups du sort
Assez parlé, au bout d'un moment, y a plus les mots
Ça y est, j'ai délaissé mon cœur dans ta paume
J'te laisserai pas t'en aller, c'est mort, j'ai mis du temps à te trouver, mi amor
Celui qui dit qu'on s'est trompé a tort, on se battra même contre les coups du sort

[Refrain]
Et je le sais, je te fais confiance, quand tu me souris, tu fais pas semblant
J'ai pas besoin d'attendre plus longtemps, je sais qu'il est temps d'partager mon sang
Et t'élever au rang de reine, au rang de reine, au rang de reine
J'vais t'élever au rang de reine, au rang de reine, au rang de reine
Oh oh ah

Au rang de... Au rang de... Je vais t'élever au rang de reine
Au rang de... Au rang de... Laisse-moi t'élever au rang de reine
Mmh hé

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby

Damn, run me back, yeah

Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter

You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up

Girl, I been drinkin' all day
It's been a long week

Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase
I promise you'll have nothing to say, nothing to say

I forgot what it feels to regret my sins
I need that old thing back lately
You can help me out baby
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration
We can put it in a song, if you want

I'll never fall for a girl like you
I'll never understand what you're going through
But your body wild and your head game too
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too
'Cause baby, I ain't cuffing, girl, I hope you knew
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "What did I do?"
Girl, you know what you did, all to blame is you

We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time

But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)

Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go

Baby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
With your heart, I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself

But girl, don't worry about me
Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely

Goddammit I luv it, I luv it

Rolling through my hood, rolling up some good
Shorty lips be rolling on the wood, damn she rode it good
Rolling over, I ain't sleeping over, now she, rolling the eye
Rolling on the floor laughing 'cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block, and I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circling your block, maybe 'cause I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
I'm a real nigga, that's real nigga, I'm just trying to chill 'cause

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
What you know about love? Well love know about you
When I try somethin' new, you refuse to believe that my love is true
So I use all I got to prove to you but the proof ain't enough so you move on
To the next dude like, "What he gon' do?"
I don't understand these girls
I don't understand these girls
Lookin' for a real nigga like in all the wrong places
And all the wrong ways, they don't care, they don't change 'cause
She gon' do what she want and that is okay
And he gon' do what he want and that is okay
I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it
He don't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' about it, love bitch

[Hook: August Alsina]
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I’ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I luv this shit

She tell me keep fucking 'cause she luv this shit and I luv it

The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

This is a Golden Remix

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Calculan que relaciones que fracasan
Mayormente es por desengaño
Falsedad que contamina y hace daño
Tú fuiste perfecto clavel que con mis manos marchité
Mi obra se llama "Romeo sin Julieta otra vez"
Puedes pensar "Soy el rey de las mentiras, volvería a fallar"
Aunque lo jure por mi vida
Mis palabras no importan ni valen ni de rodilla na' 'e na'
Dice que ha visto muchas novelas, el actor debe llorar

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
No, ¿ahora qué hago?
Ozuna y yo somos farsantes, nos ahogamo' en el fracaso
No, no juro en vano
Jamás yo vuelvo a ser infiel con chapiadoras, yo te amo
No, escúchame esa pena que siento
Voy a hacer otro disco con Aventura y te lo dedico enterito

[Coro: Ozuna, Romeo Santos]
Bebé, si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

[Verso 2: Ozuna]
Yo sin ti yo no me vuelvo a enamorar
No sé ni qué pensar
Ya sé por qué todo me sale mal
Mentí diciéndote que era leal
Siendo un amor real, le pido a Dios me pueda perdonar
No quiero que te vaya', vamo' a intentarlo
¿Por qué no salvamos nuestra relación?
Tú sabe', bebé
Perdona, bebé

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Ozuna]
Ey, bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé (ehhh)
Si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante (-sante)
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

[Verso 3: Ozuna]
Extraño tu aroma en la cama (ehh)
De ese que dejas cuando entras y sales
¿Dónde quedaron los besos y todos los planes? (oh-oh-oh)
No sé si vivir o morir (ohh)
Me encuentro en un limbo desde que te fuiste de aquí (oh-oh-oh)
Eres la única persona que yo quiero que se venga encima de mí
Mi libertad no la quiero, tampoco la vida 'e soltero
Yo lo que quiero es que quieras lo mismo que todos queremos
Tener una cuenta de banco con dígito' y muchos cero' (ehhh)
Hacer el amor a diario y de paso gastar el dinero

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Ozuna]
Dime bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé
Si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

[Chorus]
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say

Like, who been on your mind? Who got your time?

You used to be texting me, checking me, calling me your slime
And now you treat me like my worth less than a dime

And if we paint a perfect picture, we can make it last forever
And you the only one I want to wear my orange sweater

Double cupped, but bae, I'm leaning on you
You been playing games, I'm tryna make you my boo
I don't duck no action, you bust one and I bust two
Pills of satisfaction, I take the red, you pop the blue

[Verse 1]
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

[Hook]
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

[Bridge]
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've ... (and if I should fall along the way) ... been kissed by a rose on the gray
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

[Outro]
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you

Stick it in the ignition

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

Like girl, let me take care of you (From the 772)
Might as well call this "772 Love Pt. 2"

I, I, ooh, I, heart you
I promise I, I heart you (Ooh, whoa, whoa)
Don't make Melly break, babe
It's Marcus baby, ahahaha

I'm moving too fast
Got three on the dash
Bitch, I'm on your ass (I'm on your ass)
Like where is you going? (You know that this Melly, bitch)

Faithful to you, you

[Verse 1]
Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum
She just givin' head, she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young
Die when I'm young, die when I'm young

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
And she said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...

[Chorus]
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life

[Verse 2]
Valhalla is where all the righteous are led
Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cross on my neck, cross on my neck
Over 45, I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

[Pre-Chorus]
She said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...

Angels all singin' in monasteries, yeah
My soul is burning in LaFerraris
Father, sorry, Father, sorry
Halos are given to ordinary lives
No, but this ain't ordinary life

When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Every Thursday

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
It seems like pain and regret are your best friends (Ooh, oh yeah)

(Mmm, even if you don't love me back)

[Verse 1]
If life was a movie, I'd be your favourite actor
You'd be my favourite scene, you'd be my favourite chapter
My eyes never left the screen since I saw you, the one that I been after
I could watch you over and over, filled my life with laughter
And if, life was a book, you'd be my favourite author
I'd read your words night and day
And I would never bother to leave
You're the only book I would read, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And if life was a song, this would be my favourite song
I wrote this when you're gone, wonder when you're coming home
Or if you're coming home, you been gone hella long
And I'd been all alone, yeah, yeah
You used to be my comfort zone
Used to be my one and only one I wanna hold
Remember you would wanna hold me falling in my arms
So I fell for you
Foolish move that I fell for you

[Hook]
'Cause baby, yeah, I need you, I would never leave you
Wonder how you left me, you left me feeling empty
And I can't lie, you're see through, I cannot believe you
Even though you did me wrong for some reason I need you
And I can't lie, I miss you, I forgot them issues
How could you forget me when I couldn't forget you?
And baby, yeah, you're special, I could not forget you
Even when I tried, baby, I could not forget you
I can't lie, I miss you, I forgot them issues
How could you forget me when I couldn't forget you?
And baby, yeah, you're special, I could not forget you
Even when I tried, baby, I could not forget you

Girl, I want you
I need you back, I need you back (Girl)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Verse 2]
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

[Bridge]
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

They tell me, "Don't forget where you came from"
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me
I went on a mission with a bad bitch
3 AM, I'm getting Backwoods like I'm average
All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go
I just took two 30s, now I'm in my zone
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

Me and Metro Boomin' want some more, yeah
All this money made me bored, yeah
But there's lots of drugs to explore, yeah
I'm a boss, yeah, I could employ ya
Couldn't buy one, now I got four, yeah
Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yeah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yeah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yeah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore her
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go

Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

I got what you need, you feeling lonely?
I need, I need you to hold me
I hope you mean everything that you told me
I'll try to come back to you, girl, I'm sorry
If you miss me just call me
You try to diss me 'cause you salty
Did this on my own, it's all me
I just wish that you would call me

[Verse 1]
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin’ my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go ’head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 2]
My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 3]
Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That’s the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go ’head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Bridge]
Let me stay in my bag ’cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it’s a match
Attitude, dream of mine (Dream of mine)
When you say that I'm right (That I'm right)
And I find that it works every time

[Chorus]
And I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
(And I love it when we make up)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
(Go 'head, ruin my makeup)

Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal

It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"

White lights and black beaches

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Okay, lil' mama
I still ain't heard from lil' mama
We go back to Angliana when you was studying in college
But I called you and brought you out to Santa Monica
Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl, I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit
God damn, you feelin' yourself
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

Transformation, ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha

You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill

Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
Your name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh

Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa oh oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope, he made you satisfied (you did)
Well baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine

[Hook]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

[Verse 2]
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, a simple man
I try to master the art, of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been living in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know when I land you're mine

[Hook]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

(Breakdown - The Weeknd harmonizing)

[Hook]
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

[Outro (French)]
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

[Chorus: Kehlani with Ty Dolla $ign]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up (Switch it up)
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Outro: Kehlani]
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Refrain : Booba]
Nos cœurs battent trop vite, on va se crasher
Il faut réduire la vitesse
Je t'aimais, c'est du passé
J'vais me consoler chez Versace
J'ai peut-être mes défauts
J'ai merdé, je l'avoue
Seul et triste comme au dépôt
À une seule femme j'dis "I love you"
À une seule femme j'dis "I love you"
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

Première fois que je t'ai vue, je me souviens
Mademoiselle t'as quoi de prévu ? Rien...
Ton déhanché m'a laissé groggy
Deux jours plus tard je t'ai prise en doggy-style
Ton nom résonne en hauts-lieux
Nous deux c'est fini comme Banlieue Sale
Fruit défendu tu étais
Shopping sur les Champs pas à Cora
Tu m'as juste utilisé, pas de lune de Jack Miel à Bora-Bora

Je l'avais validée, je l'avais validée
Je lui ai tout donné
Elle a tout pris sans même me remercier
Elle voulait une deuxième chance
J'ai dit : "Non j'ai trop de dignité !"
Pour toute confidence, j'appelle Bambara Kouyaté
Mon bébé, je t'aurais sortie de la pauvreté

[Couplet 3 : Booba]
J'ai fouillé dans son iPhone, je n'aurais jamais dû
J'ai fouillé dans son iPhone, je n'aurais jamais dû
Photos en petite tenue
Des hommes nus, sans aucune retenue
Je lui aurais fait des enfants, elle m'a douillée
Si je te raconte, tu vas bafouiller
Mais je ne te dis rien tel que j'te connais
Toi aussi tu voudras la tuer
J'ai laissé mon cœur ouvert
Pensant que tu n'allais rien voler

Nos cœurs battent trop vite, on va se crasher

I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control (Yuh)
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so (Yuh, yuh)
I keep giving people blank stares (Yeah)
I'm so different when you're not there (Yuh)

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

[Verse 1: R. City]
Right about now
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright?
Come on, show me that you are down

All I want is somebody real, who don't need much

Would that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Intro]
It's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

[Verse 1]
What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

[Verse 2]
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
Because your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how did you drain all the soul from your eyes
How did you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no
Every touch that you sell is a lie

[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional

The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

[Verse 1]
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

[Verse 2]
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)
But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)
When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh baby)

[Bridge]
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream

[Hook]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you

I guess maybe some little problems could arise
(There are always a few)
If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(Devastating)
Because this is very good
(And that would be good)
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

[Verse 1: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell everybody that we're just friends
But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows
Same place, we're with different folks
Case closed if they crack the code
Is it me, or is you cold?
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Forbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go

I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name

We can hang out, we can just chill

[Verse 2: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell 'em all that we're just cool
As far as me and you, we got a simple code
Spendin' nights, well that's optional
No telephones in the afternoon
I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
Every time your ass in the mood
Sharin' thoughts when we share a room
Though we barely talk when we share a room
In the dark, still see your curves
Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle

Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know

I mean let's say, what if we did?
(What if?)
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(Certainly not!)
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
(I know!)
I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated
(It's almost stupid if we didn't!)
It's moronic
(Absurd!)

You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)

Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

[Chorus]
But I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

[Chorus 2]
Because I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one

[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

You must think I've got to be joking when I say

Tired of fucking with these lame niggas baby

We could start with a handshake baby
I'ma need more than a hug

Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing

When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but

[Verse 1]
I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for
If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feelin' poor
There's something 'bout you so addictive, had me needing more
Yeah, I just wanna hold you, baby, you the one I want
I know I've said this all before, but I'll say it again
You're the only one I want, and, girl, I can't pretend
I remember cloudy days, we cuddled in my bed
The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head

[Chorus]
You're the reason I believe that love is real
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me, is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' want, no, no, no

[Bridge]
I can't love nobody anymore
You're the only one that I ever want
I compare her to you, she has never won
Now I wanna just be all alone
Nobody love me like you
And I can't love nobody back
You remind me of the moon
'Cause every night, you're coming back
What am I supposed to do?
If I'm so in love with you
I cannot get over you
I cannot get over you

[Verse 2]
Since you left me, every night I go stare at the moon
Wishing it was you and I, that's something we would do
Every Sunday morning I go watch the flowers bloom
I do things we used to do, hoping I'll run into you
What's a lie, and what's the truth?
I cannot get over you
Doesn't matter what I do
Everyone just looks like you
Girl, I smell you everywhere
Smell your perfume and your hair
I try to act like I don't care
Everyone knows (That I care)

[Chorus]
You're the reason I believe that love is real (Love is real)
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me, is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon', no
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' trust like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'

[Verse 1]
I wanna know how we became so distant girl
The way we fell in love it was almost instant
I'm tryna find a way around it
Girl tell me how you feel about it
You still love me, that's the way it's sounding
Thank God I would have never found this, I doubt it
I'm there for you if you allow it
Girl you know I gotta keep you around me
All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
Spending on you baby no matter what the amount is
Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
I guess I had a hard time showing it at first but

[Hook]
Baby it's been that way
Baby it's been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
Baby it's always, always, always been that way
It's always been that way
(Didn't I tell you girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
It's always been that way

[Verse 2]
How did we become so distant?
Like I'm the one to blame and you're innocent
I try to make a way, make a difference, but
Some things don't change, I can't complain
I try not to think about you
What can I say, everytime I get near you
I want that old thing back, now bring it to me
Shorty keep telling me what to do about you
Then she got jealous soon as she knew about you
She don't never wanna see her go through round two
(Cut her off!) Cut her off that's what I'm doing now, you
Told me I should go out and do my thing
(Damn right!) Damn right I do my thing
Now you want to know what's gotten into me, what's changed?
But baby none change

[Hook]
Baby it's been that way
Baby it's been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say
Baby it's always, always, always been that way
It's always been that way
(Didn't I tell you girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby I still feel the same
Something I gotta maintain
Listen to me when I say

If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em

What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock

[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time
Find some time to do something

[Intro]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Partial Pre-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play (Yeah baby, when we face the sun)
And gun play turns into pillow talk (You'll know for sure)
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams (That I'm all yours)
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning (All yours darling)

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning (Woman, do you know what you've done to me baby?)
I don't wanna wake you (Stay darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep (Stay darling, yeah)
It's the smell of your hair (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel (Never know how it feels)
I've never felt comfortable (Feel like this, woman)

[Chorus]
Turns into coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end)
Coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end of me)
I don't wanna wake you (You'll never be the end of me, darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep (Yeah baby, be the end of me, baby)
It's the smell of your hair (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel (Never felt like this, woman)
I've never felt comfortable like this (Feel like this, darling, no)

[Outro: Miguel]
All right, old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye

I'm just gon' keep on doin' me (Doin' me)
Now I don't know what else to say except
I'm so falsely accused
Tell me how can you judge when you've never walked in my shoes
So easy to mess up someone else's life
Through social media, the devil in disguise
I admit I miss my brothers (Brothers)
But I admit they weren't acting like brothers (Brothers)
Yeah, we've had our differences
But you don't turn on your brother (No)
For nothing (No), for no one (No), nada (No)
Mama (No), Joanne (No), is watching
She must be turning over in her grave (Yeah)
I admit I had to borrow a couple of M's from the label (Label)
All these hits out but I couldn't put food on the table (Table)
I was told I had to sell my cars (Cars)
I was told I couldn't get a loan (Loans)
Said I owed 20 million to the IRS and they was coming to get my home (Oh, oh)
I admit I was feeling stupid, staying in the Homewood Suites (No disrespect)
Sippin' Hennessy, tryna figure out what happened to me (Happened to me)
There was so much going through my head (My head)
'Cause I knew that something wasn't right (Wasn't right)
I just couldn't put my finger on it (No)
But my spirit had better eyes (Better)
It told me what it saw (Saw)

It said get rid of them all (All)
It's nothing but vultures 'round me (Me)
I admit that I love my fans (My fans)
For all the push and support they've shown (Yeah, you)
I admit if it wasn't for them (For them)
I would've never stayed strong (Oh)
Now I'm not trippin' on all of these rumors, that don't bother me
And I'm not payin' attention to these haters, that don't bother me (Oh, oh)
But what blows me is when certain people turn phony (Phony)
They say, "Rob, I got your back; Rob, you the man"
But they really doubting me
Bitch, you know who you are
Bitch, I bought you a car (Yeah)
Bitch, you stayed in my crib (Yeah, yeah)
I loved you with all my heart (My heart)
Now I don't like to brag when it comes to me (Comes to me)
But I've given back to the community (Community)
From the non-profits to the charities (Charities)
But of course, you never hear that about me (About me)
To them niggas that drink my liquor and smoke my stogies
How come you ain't on Facebook takin' up for me
While you 'round me most of the day (Oh)
When you know that I'm a good brother
Always got your hands out, it ain't no doubt (Yeah)
That y'all niggas ain't nothing but blood suckas
Plus, y'all ain't bringing nothing to the table (No, no)
Yeah nigga, and you know it's real talk (Real talk)
Taking pictures with me for your Instagram
But when I need you, you quick to get lost (Can't find you)
Mm, oh, mm, oh, oh, oh, no, no, ooh, woah, I
Robert, Jay, and Joanne, my kids
What you hearin' out here about dad, guys, I'm sorry for this (Sorry)
I'm so sorry, I can't imagine what y'all must be goin' through (Goin' through)
Every day its somethin' about me, my God, it must be killin' you (Killin' you)
I promise there'll be better days (There'll be better days)
Just keep walkin' straight (Just keep walkin' straight)
I know you must be worried but just know that I'm okay (Oh, I'm okay)
For me, things have gotten rough (Rough)
Right now I can't say too much (Say too much)
But for y'all I will stay tough (Oh, oh)
Daddy just need y'all to trust (Trust)
And believe in me (In me)
I admit that I've told the truth (Told the truth)
And still not free (Not free)
Still wanna hate me (Yeah), still wanna stone me (Stone me, yeah)
Still wanna chain me (Chain me, yeah), I think they wanna kill me

[Chorus]
I admit it, admit it (I admit it)
I admit it, I did it  (I did it, yeah)
I admit it, I did (I)
I admit it, I did, did it

[Verse 8]
Now, no disrespect to Chi-Town, my home (My home)
But we've got to learn how to support our own (Our own)
I admit that my heart cries for my city (My city)
'Cause we're losing young lives in the city (My city)
Instead of judging me (Judging me)
Y'all should be using me (Using me)
To help these kids, raise them out of depression and poverty (Oh, oh)
Now, I'm not saying I'm no savior (No savior)
But I can be an inspiration (Inspiration)
This is an invitation
Man, I admit I go through so much day to day (Day to day)
Got 23 lawyers, three or four managers, what am I doing? Show me the way (Oh)
The only thing I have left is my voice (My voice)
And now I have to use it for my protection (Yeah)
Because they left me no choice (No choice)
See my work has nothing to do with my private life
So stay the fuck out of my business and tend to your own damn life (Life)
So go 'head, say what you want to say (Want to say)
About who I want to date (I want to date)
But you won't say that shit to my face (To my face)
'Cause you know it ain't shit to say (Oh, oh-oh)
Next nigga bring me some dumb shit (Dumb shit)
It's gon' be a misunderstanding (Yeah)
'Cause niggas, they listen to dumb shit (Dumb shit)
Are niggas that be on that dumb shit (Dumb shit)
They need a light 'cause they ain't got no life
So they always conjuring up dumb shit (Dumb shit)
Blockin' my path (Path), they don't know the half (Half)
And so they make an assumption (Assumption)
Since when do assumptions (Since when?)
Cost a man his whole career? (Whole career)
Found guilty when you're innocent, is the only times that I fear (I fear)
There is one thing that's for sure (For sure)
And I want to make this shit clear (Clear)
I done lived my voice (Yeah) and represented my country (Yeah) for 31 fuckin' years (Yeah)
Damn it, I admit

Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby

Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug

Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know

You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or, live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk

Take the top off, let the sun come in (The lord still shines on you)
Whoa, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (Again)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, "Turn the snubs off!"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me

Let me know I'm in control

Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering
I'm wondering, If I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now
I want you now, oh

Can you love me for poor?
I'm searching for my soul
Who ever turned you cold?
You need to let him know

And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes

I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (Uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (Okay)

And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer

Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out what you tweaking for
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now you tryna act like I'm creeping though
Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

I been touching hoes the same way that I touch you
Fucking hoes the same way that I fuck you
Treating hoes the same way, but I trust you
I don't love you, but I love you
Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

At Warwick every Wednesday
Can't control you
Partyin' with rappers
Actin' hoeish too
You got yourself a singer, ah

Draped you head to toe in GucciGhost, wow
And I never got a single fuckin' thank you from you
Or, "I love you daddy"

The more the baddie, more the bratty

Take you shopping for them clothes

I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

[Verse 1]
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 2]
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
"Where you at, G? Answer your phone!"
Pause the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 3]
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face of your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
"Look blud I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that"
Not long ago you were miming to the "Shook Ones"
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

[Bridge]
You better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

[Chorus]
I wanna turn those blue lights
What have you done
Into strobe lights
There's no need to run
Not blue flashing lights
If you've done nothing wrong
Maybe fairy lights
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Outro: Jorja Smith & Dizzee Rascal]
"Blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
"Blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
What have you d-d-d-done done
Don't you run
Don't you run
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming

Out of place, out of space and time, wide awake
Out of papers I am, not okay
I am out my mind
Outer space, that’s where I been goin'
To a place where, place where nobody knows
Floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don’t

I do not feel the fear of fallin, I wanna fly
If it all goes well then I will
But what if I don’t?

[Bridge]
Ill be right where I was before
But I’m not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough

Wait...

[Verse 2]
Now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
I am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
Broken promise of everything that I thought you were
Thought you said this would never hurt, that’s what it did that is all

[Hook]
I do not feel the fear of falling
Thought I could fly
It didn’t go well but oh well
What do you know

[Bridge]
I’m right back where I was before
But I’m not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough

I'm a be so cold, need some more
I’ve never felt these things before
I’m a feind for sure, please don't go
How could you not need me no more?

You're the only thing that I love
You’re the only thing that I want
You’re the only reason, the only reason

I do not feel the fear of fallin', I wanna fly
If it all goes well, then I will
But what if I don’t?

You're all that I know

Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I

We can do it baby simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up!
Writer babe, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby you could be the note, record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one, cause you are ten, real and not pretend!

Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I

Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

[Bridge]
Rock with me baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me baby
Rock with me baby
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me baby
This love between you and I
As simple as pie baby
Such a sure thing, oh is it a sure thing
Such a sure thing, oh is it a sure thing
Such a sure thing, oh is it a sure thing

[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes fallin
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing

[Outro]
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover

[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Verse 1]
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know that they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story

[Verse 2]
You might have tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?

[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Verse 3]
Coming and going
Inside out and back to front
Oh, tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me

[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily

Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Verse 1]
I know that you think this song is for you
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you

[Hook]
'Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Verse 2]
No, I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said, I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind

[Interlude]
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars

[Hook]
This ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh, yeah
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch, I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop
'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?
Racism on television and magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am, livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man, who gives a fuck about it?
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it

[Intro]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find
Should have known better, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Post-Chorus]
Never without your love

[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

[Chorus]
And I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Outro]
Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
Now that you're gone, was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous

[Verse 2]
I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Girl
Call it passive or aggressive?

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous (Jealous)

[Bridge]
You're the only one invited (Invited)
Say there's no one else for you (For you)
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful (Beautiful)
And everybody wants a taste

Oh, that's why I still get jealous (Jealous, jealous, jealous)

[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

Ooh
Na na, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

[Verse 3]
So, I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I'll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)

[Outro]
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

Oh, boy, I'ma have to call them boys on you
Awe damn, awe damn, I'ma have to call that man on you
Something, something, something must be really wrong with you
Why can't you just tell the fuckin' truth now?
Yes your mama did, she raised a fool, wow
What the fuck did you learn in that schoolhouse?
To chase them thrills, chasin' thrills
Takin' pills in the hills, Slauson Hills, Overhills might get you killed
Not welcome 'round them parts no more
Do not run your mouth no more
I can't protect you no more
It's out of my hands for sure

[Chorus]
You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh…

[Verse 2]
Okay, now you wanna say all that I’ve done to ya
You knew all along that I wasn't the one for you
So let's stop pretending like we were in love
We never shared anything but the drugs
We were both numb, never had anything real between us
We really must
Be smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels
My bros really in the field
Neighborhood is really real and they don't play that here
You shouldn't say that here
You should've made it clear, my dear
You should've called me

You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh, you should've called me

Ohh, oh

Ya understand me?
From the Overhill to the fronts to the back mayne

So don't worry 'bout none of this shit from this funny ass nigga
Don't worry 'bout him callin' you and all the rest of that shit
You know what? It's his lost, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm pretty p'd
I heard the homie, the homie called me and was like
"Man, Jhené trippin, man, this buster ass nigga got her mind fucked up"

Now you got me thinkin' 'bout you all night
Me and you, seemed like it'd be alright
Long as we can keep it all night

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready
Leave here, too on
Tell me where I'm headed
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told her ‘Bae I’m ready. Bae I want it
I can go all the way until the mornin'
We could do all different type of positions
I'ma have you suckin' on my fingers while I hit it
From the back, you like it like that
I know 50 different ways to make you climax
You got the flavored oil, girl you nasty
Rubbin' lotion on you, you ain't even ashy
Tryna get you to the room and take you down
Come give it to a thug, give it to a real one

[Chorus: Jeremih & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready (Yeah she ready)
Leave here, too on (On)
Tell me where I'm headed (Where I'm headed)
Tree leaf, a little O (Little O)
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that (Oh yeah)
Come here, I'm down with it (Yeah)
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

Why did we go all the way?
What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?

[Hook: Mr. Hudson]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Verse 1: Future]
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals

We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

[Verse 3: Future]
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

[Bridge: Future]
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft
You can't be lettin' the rap shit go to your head
Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil
That's why we gotta continue to pray together

Yeah
Uh uh
Oh no no no

We can go together

We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

[Verse 1]
Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed in my girl clutch
White girls so twelve, never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
She need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's a lot of us
They talk shit but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get ... in the face with a full clip
Get ... in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get ... with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains
When really they livin', we gotta ball
This is world war three, I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown
I'ma do that thing
Girl, you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident with hair like Django?
How we walk in the room and the girls they notice?
'Cause they know you bogus
I'm the man you noticed
And

[Chorus]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try

[Verse 2]
I'ma show you how to do this
It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

[Outro]
We can go together
It doesn't really matter

When you come tonight, squeeze me tight
Hold me close, kiss my cheek, caress my soul
Take good care, stroke my hair, make me blush
Go so deep that my mind is fogged
You know it's been some time since I've tried guys this young
Not too many of 'em are honest
But he holds it down, stands his ground, play his move
Doesn't rush to get into my body

[Hook]
And that's that shit that I like, like, like, like, like
A man who can open my mind, a man who can open mind
Is it wrong that I really, really, really, really want you?
And there's no need to ask, you feel it too

[Bridge]
Do you, do you, do you feel it?
Do you, do you, do you mean it?
Do you, do you, do you feel it?
Do you, do you

[Verse 2]
So come tonight, run the lights, say your close
Fuck these hoes, I want your time
Tees and sweats, hair's a mess, Netflix's on
Still your eyes are glued to mine
You understand me, and it's all I need

[Hook]
And that's that shit that like, like, like, like, like
A man who can open my mind, a man who can open my mind
Is it wrong that I really, really, really, really want you?
And there's no need to ask, you feel it too

[Verse 3]
Are you here to rescue me?
Are you here to go and get a check with me?
Are you here to pillow talk?
Or are you here to bounce and pull out when this shit get hard?
Are you here to make shit right
Are you here to loan me your chest when I cry at night?
Are you here to set me up, get me hyped, turn around and just leave my life?
I told him that's that shit that I'm used to
Don't blame me for my issues
He know deep inside I really wanna have him
The little things what makes him so attractive
Got him opening and holding doors
Touching me in places like a tourist

[Hook]
That's that shit that I like
A man who can open my mind
That's that shit that I like
A man who can open my mind

You know I wouldn't walk away even if I could
It took one night, one try, ayy
Damn, I'm hooked (oh)

[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]

And baby when you take control, we can go all night
Every single place we go, you start a fight

[Intro]
One day, I'm gonna understand...
Zion

[Verse 1]
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
"Look at your career," they said
"Lauryn, baby use your head"
But instead I chose to use my heart

[Chorus]
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

[Verse 2]
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

[Chorus]
That the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)

(Mumbling)

[Teacher]
I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

[Boy]
Willingness to do everything for that person

[Teacher]
Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

[Boy 2]
The way they act

[Teacher]
Uh-huh

[Boy 2]
The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

[Teacher]
Okay

[Girl]
The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

[Girl 2]
Yeah

[Girl]
It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

[Teacher]
That's deep

[Boy 2]
That's what I'm talking about

[Teacher]
I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

[Girl 2]
It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up

If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now,  that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break, was monotonous

[Verse 2: Joba]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always rapping
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish
Just kidding, I love you assholes

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up

If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love

Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow

Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

[Chorus: Harry & All]
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

[Verse 2: Liam]
Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity, infinity, infinity
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like Infinity (infinity)
Infinity (infinity), Infinity, yeah
Infinity

Ten thousand miles up in the sky
We never land 'cause we stay fly
I'ma be your bitch for life

Put your diamonds in the light
And let 'em see you shine bright

You got one leg in the air, tap it like you broke
Sweating out your weave, girl, fuck that hoe
Girl, you ain't gotta leave, we gon' fuck this hoe
Percocets and molly's make you touch your toe
Been in this bitch so long, I'm going up a dose

Got them blue diamonds dancing in my party, democratic

Got about a thousand upon my side
We out here hustlin', risking our life
Fill cocaine up in your tights
We had to make it across the line

You just wanna live a nigga life
Sittin' in a helicopter, I can touch the sky
Fuck them hoes
Just fuck them hoes

[Chorus]
Now that I am sober
I take back what I said
I'm sittin' with this love hangover
And boy, it's hurtin' my head
It's the middle of October
And we just came to an end
I'm just sorry that there ain't no time left
You and I, we're over
Me and you are done
When I wanted to be closer
You just wanted to run
Though I know it's no one's fault
If I've learned anything at all
With us, no matter how I add it up, uh
One plus one is none

[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind for a while now
Tryna get you off 'cause this ain't right now
You said it was a vibe for the time being
It was nothing more, but I just couldn't see it
This is not a song for the whole world
Felt like it could've been us against the whole world
Baby, you were mine and I was your girl
Whatever happened to the time that we spent

[Chorus]
Sober
I take back what I said
I'm sittin' with this love hangover
And boy, it's hurtin' my head
It's the middle of October
And we just came to an end
I'm just sorry that there ain't no time left
You and I, we're over
Me and you are done
When I wanted to be closer
You just wanted to run
Though I know it's no one's fault
If I've learned anything at all
With us, no matter how I add it up
One plus one is none

[Verse 2]
I've been at this party for some time now
Sippin' on Bacardi 'til it runs out
You are in the corner with your head down
I don't even wanna know what that's about
'Cause you're the one that's always gettin' too wasted
And I'm the one that's never that intoxicated
Tonight I'm in my feelings, oh, I'm faded
But I don't wanna think about the complicated
Oh, your love got me feeling like I
Can't get up, wishing for it but it
Never lasts
I thought we'd be together, oh, it ended so fast

[Chorus]
Now that I am sober
I take back what I said (I take it back, I take it back)
I'm sittin' with this love hangover
And boy, it's hurtin' my head
It's the middle of October (It's the middle of October, huh)
But we just came to an end
I'm just sorry that there ain't no time left
'Cause you and I, we're over
Me and you are done
'Cause when I wanted to be closer (Nah)
You just wanted to run
Though I know it's no one's fault
If I've learned anything at all
With us, no matter how I add it up, huh
One plus one is none

That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out

Feeling unsure of my naked body
Stand back, watch it taking shape
Wondering why I don't look like Barbie
They say boys like girls with a tiny waist
Now, my mama's preaching to make sure I'm pure
But, I never really cared 'bout this shit before
Look around the room to whoever wants me

[Pre-Chorus]
Got boys acting like they ain't seen skin before
Got sent home to change 'cause my skirt is too short

[Chorus]
It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one told them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

[Verse 2]
Gotta make sure that my legs are shiny
Hot wax melting, burn my skin
People all around me are watching closely
'Cause it's how I look and not what I think

[Pre-Chorus]
Mikey's eyes seem to be glued to her chest
So, I'm stuffing my bra so that mine look the best

[Chorus]
It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one told them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

Instead of making me feel bad for the body I got
Just teach him to keep it in his pants and tell him to stop

Sayin' it's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top

Nope
Didn't think so

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a play about the joke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh! Baby, we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game MVP like Steve Nash?

[Chorus - Variation: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' ya name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait

Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

All those times I said that I loved you

And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I'mma help you build up your account

When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
It take me just to compliment the deals (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look, ladies that's a good look)

Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you
I can up, can I up, let me upgrade you?

I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
[Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]
[Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things, and upgrade you]
[I can (up), can I (up), let me, upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you]

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

[Intro: Keri Hilson talking]
Uh, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Mmh)
"Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today" (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp shit flying high (Flying high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Hey, oh, it comes around)
And it knocks you down (Hey, yeah)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down) (Hey)
Sometimes love comes around (Ooh, whoa, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Get back up when it knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around) (When love comes around)
And it knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh, when it knows you down, knocks you down)

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (Oh, no, when it knocks you down)
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh

I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need

I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

[Verse 2]
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty
I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from bein' lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 2]
Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust
Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stoppin' ground
And soon to be my past

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will (C'mon)

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time

Brenda's got a baby

[Verse: 2Pac]
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
"That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family"
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

Had me questioning myself
I wasn't sure enough
Had me looking in the mirror
Tryna analyze my figure
I ain't perfect
You want perfect
So that figures
You always put me in a bad place (Oh, oh)
Said we were moving at a fast pace
It was all my fault
I fell in love too hard

[Chorus]
I loved you when I didn't love myself (Yeah, yeah)
Said you loved me, but you only loved yourself
You rocked me so hard
You played all your cards right
You played with my heart
(I might) I might not be the same way

[Verse 2]
You were walking in that door, you wasn't saying "Hi"
You were walking out that door, you wasn't saying "Bye, bye" (Oh, oh)
Seems like you only got that way when things ain't go your way (Oh, oh)
How could you tell me you love and behave this way
Sometimes I don't
Know how I survived
You picked me up
You threw me in the sky
And when I fell, you let me hit the ground
I still felt alone with you around
I learned my lesson
Yeah, shit got hectic
But all in all, the experience it was a blessing
You taught me patience
Can't skip the basics
Seems like you only wanted me for that sensation (Yeah)
I remember all the lies (All the lies)
All the night you made me cry (Made me cry)
When you controlled my mind (You controlled my mind)
Had me wishing I would die (Had me wishing I would die)
You will never know how I feel (How I feel)
I gave my all to you, my love was real (My love was real)
But you didn't love me
But you didn't love me

[Chorus]
I loved you when I didn't love myself
Said you loved me, but you only love yourself
You rocked me so hard
You played all your cards right
You played with my heart
I might (I might)
Might not be the same way
Might not be the same Lay

You were my sun
You were my earth

So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say what you did

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it

Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty

Always got what I wanted
Never asked nobody for nothin'

But if you want it you
Gotta come with somethin' new

So over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable
Oh-oh, oh
Gettin' real comfortable treatin' me like a regular
Don't bring out the worst in me when I bring out the best in you
Boy, I ain't average

[Intro]
Welcome back, welcome back to the very very very late night show
I’m your host like every night LB
And uhhh we got two of the biggest stars in the world right now
I mean, we can’t go anywhere without hearing their names
Now you two usually keep it private but you’re about to open up and uhhh I guess we’ll start with you
And tell us how you’re feeling

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
See I’m a real woman
A women that doesn’t need much but
Appreciates a whole lot
And he always call me crazy, but i’m not crazy
I’m from LA where the sun’s always shining so a lot of people are shady
But at least I got my baby

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Yeah, right baby
Right, look
What’s the difference between real love and fake love
The same difference between real titties and fake ones
You can feel the difference
And even though it changes overtime
It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though, it takes persistence
But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop
That’s why I send for you like the call drop
Plus I know all your insecurities
And I don’t mean like mall cops
I mean the type we all got
I’m never focused on my exes more than our execution
No time to be stressed and confusing
A happy home is the best to move in
Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion
My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion
Because when you think it’s there, it’s already moving
And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in
And I know both of our families are divorced and suing
But look, this ain't repetition, it’s evolution
You changed the theory up
You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up
And all your friends around you try to get their appearance up
When you ain't even wearing much
But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up

[Interlude]
Wow. I mean… make some noise for em'
Everybody, make some noise
I mean that’s, that’s real love you know?
That’s beautiful. Makes me want to call my wife up and tell her I love her. You seem like a stand-up guy, like you really have her best interest… oh

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Yeah he’s sweet
I mean you know when he wants to be not all the time
Let’s not front in front of all these people nigga
Don’t act like just a couple weeks ago you wasn’t fucking with them bitches
Out here, disrespecting me
I mean you know I fucked up too
Went through your phone you wasn’t looking
And I found out, but if we in the same house, the same building
Then you can’t interrupt a happy home that’s still buildin'
You ol’ sneaky ass nigga

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Fuck is you saying
Who are you talkin to
Never called you a bitch, but who are you barking to
Look you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga
Who are you trying, am I on trial?
Are you not the number one on my speed dial
You know that you tripping
You need guidance
You got these people inside our business
Like U and I is
You probably didn’t even catch that did you
You’re too undivided
You’re too undecisive
You’re too one sided
You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it
And then talk to me like you’re the pro when I’m the one that’s been providing
I hate talking about what’s private when we not in private
‘Cause I don’t want to say nothing to piss your mother off
Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom
Let’s take the covers off
And talking about how you fucking what’s his name who’s so fucking lame
I wish I would’ve known before I took the rubber off (ah!)
Got me questioning like is this even love at all
I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball
Looking for some feelings in the lost and found
Contemplating
Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down if we can’t even hold on a conversation
You take the sex away then what else are we left to lay in
I’m tired of fronting for these people who ain't got our back
‘Cause to them it’s all entertainment
And they not looking at us like we real people
Or like we up here just fuckin playing
And time’s the only thing we can’t afford
Then why would waste it
How we supposed to face our problems
If we can’t even face to face it

Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Uhh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (yeah, yeah)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin'
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modellin'
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing, cause when you chase the pussy
It’s a sin, but if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
CyHi! Yeah! Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin through them circles boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings so trust me, dawg, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Interlude: Big Sean & Kanye West]
G.O.O.D., I do it
Music a bubble, not looking for trouble
B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks (bitch!)
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I’m in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Yo bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from, quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch, and you don’t want no problems
On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleepin' on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout

Hello, welcome to the other side
You're lost
Baby step outside your mind
You've been really good
You've been really good
You've been thinking bout being bad ever since I put you on
She got money for blow
Just check her damn nose

You can mix it with the oh
And if you wanna do it, baby
I'm right here with you
I'm on cloud nine
Baby you're behind
You can follow me
You can follow me if you want

To go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step you’re the life of the party
Know that step you’re the life of the party

I got two little ladies
I got one little room
There's a room full of liquor
Baby what you wanna do?
The way you move got me feeling so uhh

I'm so far gone and you are too

How you feel
How you breathe
Baby how you do it so good?
How you twist with your hips got the room so small baby
And girl please don't go
You're gonna please my boys
You been thinking about it baby
Yeah you're a star
Oh you knocked one down
Girl you knocked it down

Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something

Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me

’Cause lately I've been thinkin' 'bout you and rebuildin’
Walking 'round like you lost feelings

[Intro: Solange]
You got the light, count it all joy
You got the right to be mad
But when you carry it alone you find it only getting in the way
They say you gotta let it go

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Now tell 'em why you mad son
Cause doing it all ain't enough
'Cause everyone all in my cup
'Cause such and such still owe me bucks
So I got the right to get bucked
But I try not to let it build up
I'm too high, I'm too better, too much
So I let it go, let it go, let it go

[Pre-Hook 1: Solange]
I ran into this girl, she said, "Why you always blaming?"
"Why you can't just face it?" (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
"Why you always gotta be so mad?" (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
"Why you always talking shit, always be complaining?"
"Why you always gotta be, why you always gotta be so..." (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
I got a lot to be mad about (Be mad, be mad, be mad)

[Hook: Solange]
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love, baby?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, but I got a lot to be mad about
Got a lot to be a man about, got a lot to pop a xan about
I used to rock hand-me-downs and now I rock standing crowds
But it's hard when you only got fans around and no fam around
And if they are, then their hands are out and they pointing fingers
When I wear this fucking burden on my back
Like a motherfucking cap and gown
Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down
And I laugh at frowns—what they mad about?
Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account
That didn't wear a cap and gown
Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?
And when I attempted suicide, I didn't die
I remember how mad I was on that day
Man, you gotta let it go before it get up in the way
Let it go, let it go

[Pre-Hook 2: Solange]
I ran into this girl, she said, "Why you always blaming?"
"Why you can't just face it?"

I got a lot to be mad about (Be mad, be mad, be mad)

Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love, baby?

What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who? Cleopatra? Please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Why, why do I have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl

In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

These are things I gotta say to you
Make me feel irreplaceable, baby

Let me put my stamp on it, let me crop all them other niggas
Out the picture, I say fuck them other niggas
Won't you say it with me?
My homeboy left the crib to me, baby, you should stay with me
For as long as I'm here, baby that's okay with me
For as long you want, baby that's okay with me

Fuck it girl, come spend the night with me
Say whatever, just don't lie to me
Stepping out, know I want you on the side of me
Mama, you could come work, full-time with me
Roll through in the Bimmer, get inside
'Til the wheels fall off, that's how long you can ride with me

Haha, yeah, I'ma let it ride
I got some questions for you
I'm just tryna know you better, you know?
Right about now! (take off)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Let's start with the basics, your in seam, what your waist is?
Nail color, shoe size, what designer's your favorite?
Trick dollar, I plays this, couple niggas you played with
Kenzo, gift bags for all the bitches you came with
These niggas on the same shit, Red Lobster, Red Bottom
Sell dope, don't think, next day, Feds got 'em
Rrrrah! But I'm still here, you see I'm still here
A lot of niggas just came and went
But at least you know that it's real here
Fly you down to where the Heat go
Lay you out to where the beach go
Jet ski, parasail, yacht as big as my ego (woo!)
Heart cold as ever, but I can show you better
If we're gon' roll together, I gotta get to know you better

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Tell me what's your name, tell me, tell what's your sign
Tell me what you into, tell me, tell what you like
If you was rich tomorrow, tell me what would you do with it
And if you could see the future, baby do you see me in it?
Would you date me for a minute girl before you let me hit it?
Are you single? Are you taken? Working towards your education?
I'm just askin, I'm just sayin, what's your current situation?
Cause I see you 'cross the room and you the baddest in the building
What's up?

[Pre-Chorus: Omarion]
See I don’t wanna get into your draws yet (oh yeah)
Are you one of them girls that’s askin' where the bread's at? (Oh yeah)
See first I need to know just where your head at
'Fore you give me some (heh, I’m playin')

[Chorus: Omarion]
I’m just tryna know you, better
I’m just tryna know you, yeah
I’m just tryna know you, better
I’m just tryna know you, yeah-eah-eah
If I told you my secret, shawty would you keep it?
Are you the type to kiss me, right after I eat it? Yeah
I’m just tryna know you, better

[Verse 3: Omarion]
Tell me where you goin', tell me, tell me where you from
Are you a smoker or a drinker? Are you none of the above?
Are you more domesticated? Do you love to hit the club?
Tell me do you like to fuck or do you just like making love?
Tell me, do you have some kids? And if so girl, how many?
And if not, then shawty tell me, can I be your baby daddy?
I’m just playin 'less you let me, I won’t know unless you tell me
I just gotta ask, cause girl you super bad, what’s up?

[Pre-Chorus: Omarion]
See I don’t wanna get into your draws yet (oh yeah)

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
(Nice) Are you single? Are you datin'? Is it kinda complicated?
Did you hear that time is money? Are you bein' compensated?
Did you fuck first night and spent the next day contemplatin'?
Did you focus givin' head? Baby were you concentratin'?
These the things I wanna know, do I really wanna know?
In a time where everybody’s high and nothing’s on the low
And they always on the go, snappin' pictures in Miami
Swear you take the best pictures, you should win a Instagrammy
And I give her compliments, while wonderin' who bought her that
Let her do that thing I like, wonderin' who taught her that
Wanna know you better, but I know better
Cause I left her, then O met her

[Chorus: Omarion]
I’m just tryna know you, better
I’m just tryna know you, yeah
I’m just tryna know you, better
I’m just tryna know you, yeah-eah-eah
If I told you my secret, shawty would you keep it?
Are you the type to kiss me, right after I eat it? Yeah
I’m just tryna know you, better

[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Is a good reason to go

I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break

And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

Ooh

A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now

Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got 70 days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm all on my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?
Whoever held you down
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

[Verse 2]
Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche Bugatti design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl

In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Replacing you was so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (Baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

She said, I don't want a model
I don't want a movie star
You don't have to win the lotto
I want you to win my heart

She said I just want someone true
She said I just want someone to

Smoke with me babe
And lay with me babe
And laugh with me babe

To smoke with me babe
And laugh with me baby
And lay with me babe
Cause I just want the simple things
And I just want you

I just wanna keep my Tom Fords on while I get some head
Hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up, oh
I take your spirit like the grim reaper
Hold you so close I feel your heart beatin’
Damn size with that juice, juice, we conversate and do jitsu
Pass off that loud to you, you gon’ roll it up with no issue
It’s why this can’t be keeping one thou’
Just knowing you gon’ be there when the mile down there with me
New Range Rover Autobiography
You can let your girl get in front, I play the back seat
Relaxing your mind, that’s my intuition
Once our chemistry combine, love is revolution
I cherish every moment, I’m a better man
I get to dancing with the devil, hope you understand
I be floating ’round with the sauce bag on me
I hope you hold me down ’til I fade away

[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried

They don't fucking trust me
They probably all right though
I know I'm an asshole
No reply to all your texts, girl, I do you mad cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you're just
Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys
Not looking for God, but you're down on your knees
I'm all that you want, but not what you need, girl, why?

Tell me why do you still love me
Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me
Yeah, you still love me

All your friends tell you they hate me

Couple weeks ago they were inside my sheets naked
Club, so you can Snapchat
Titties out to snap that
I know that you do that shit just hoping for a snap back

Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys

Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me

You get along quite nicely
You ask me why I cut my hair
And changed myself completely

To joining the marching band
I made the closest friends
I'll ever have in my lifetime

Please don't ask me any questions

Woke up in the hills this morning
Asking myself, how did I get here this morning?
'Vante Parker in that teal and orange
And Russell in that gold and purple
Youngest from the Ville, important
I used to sit up in my room and ponder
Finished school and get a Doctors
I'm twenty-two, I gotta get it now
Man who knew he'd have it figured out?
Trapsoul, man, I crack codes
Crack cocaine, that's what we putting out
These fuck niggas saying
Don't forget when you was broke, I was looking out
And some say there's levels to this shit
Damn look at all the levels that I skipped
Feeling like there's a medal I should get
All these haters getting heavy on my dick
Look at my niggas, chasing paper
Getting books with my niggas
So how the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas?
Your two cents ain't working for me
All you niggas sound commercial to me, man
I don't like commercial niggas
Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you
(Fuck your feelings)
Don't take it personal (it's nothing personal)
This a Derby City come up, this a Derby City vertical
First 48, straight murder you

For years and years we waited on this
Living in a place folks didn't know exist
Surprise motherfucker, we up in this bitch
I said I'm back and I'm so much better

And I won't stop (Louis)
I can't stop
Not now (Louis) not ever (Louis, Louis)

[Verse 2]
Louis slugger with the hits
Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch
I'm watching how you pitch
I'm not from Houston, no, I'm not from 'round the six
Got the four series, I should cop the six after the World Series
I just talked to Rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches
And how these snakes can harm me with bad business
Damn, fuck out of here, nigga
It's very rare for young black men to come up out of here, nigga
Some will call it luck and some will call me up
I ain't heard from you in years
Please get the fuck out my ear, nigga
My peers get it
Only G-O-D can judge me, fuck the jurisdiction
I'm working, ain't got time for thirsting
Over how these chicks appear in pictures
I'm just painting crystal-clear pictures
Brushing up on my lyrics nigga
I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious

Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
At my front door just to say you're alo-o-one tonight

Watch your mouth when you lettin' shit slide
Don't you know I got way too much pride?
Sneak dissin' way on the other side
I turn your fucking wave to a tide
I'm so fucking tired, somehow I still find the time
To care a little more about my rhymes
To care a little more about my peers
To think a little less about my fears
To care a little more about your ears
I give a piece of me to everybody I meet
Not because they want it, it's because it's prolly a need
Claim they woke but they probably asleep, in a cage
Thinking if they make a mill they be free like Meek, nah
I turned a nightmare right into a dream, yeah
I keep my sanity, 'cause I ain't on the scene, yeah
I know I gotta be a rock like Dwayne
So, I'm tryna be a rock like Dwayne, Carter Rebirth
Put that line in reverse, add a little reverb, yeah
We work, so my niggas ain't gotta be on T-Shirts
Watch me get my hands dirty with the rework
Damn, do I even have the fans for this shit?
To be rapping like these people understanding this shit
It's demanding and shit, but I stand for these kids
Like they stan for the kid, understand, how we clear
Crack a beer when I'm feelin' pissed, hmm, yeah
But I ain’t got nobody hand up my back, you ventriloquist
Ever since my songs went platinum like Sisqó
Life done found a filter like VSCO, ay
But it's okay, 'cause
If you down and you need a lil' help, it's a way
If you hatin' and you feelin' insecure, Issa Rae
I'm somewhere between humble and hell nah
These niggas drop their second album then fell off
My nonchalant flow will never end right
It be at they necks if it's in sight
Squeezing until they crack a windpipe
Loosen the grip, have a lil' remorse
You dial 9-1-1 I pull up in a Porsche
Word is I'm carrying the torch and I ain't wanna share
So beware if you reach you get scorched
Ever since I jumped off the porch
I knew that I would grow to be the boy
The boy then grew to be the man
Learned how to kill a hook, Peter Pan
I'm tryna make the end stand out
But I'm so fucking outstanding
I'm so fucking outlandish and a opp can't win
Man's not hot
I been on ten, landslide wins, yeah

When her body touch, her body touch your grill

Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner

[Couplet 1 : Nekfeu]
C'est pour mes frères et sœurs d'une autre mère
On a acquis le statut d'famille
Mon reuf a toujours couvert mes arrières
J'continuerai de mentir à sa petite amie
Ma mère peut l'engueuler comme si c'était son fils
S'il s'tape, je vais sauter d'office dans la mêlée (ouais !)
Même si mes habits coûtent cher, c'est la même
Même si c'est lui qu'a cherché la merde
C'est vrai qu'il est pas réaliste, j'ai les boules de le voir
Décevoir ses rents-pa et perdre son temps
On est trente sur la liste, on déboule devant la boite
Y'en a un qui rentre pas ? Personne rentre !
J'suis le seul à te voir quand t'as pas les cheveux lissés
Notre équipe était massive au lycée, et tu le sais
Dans mon équipe, y'avait quasiment que des têtes cramées
J'étais celui qu'on envoyait pour paraître civilisés
Des urgences, des mariages, des naissances
Des procès, des nuits blanches et des micro-siestes
Tous mes amis en ont dans le ventre
Mais ça ne se voit pas comme un déni d'grossesse

[Pont : Nekfeu]
C'est pour mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey
Je te parle de mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les sœurs, pas les potes, hey hey
Je te parle de mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, les traîtres, on les fuck

[Refrain : Ed Sheeran]
When you feel lonely
Know which way to go
I'll be calling you (S-Croums)
I'll be calling you (Ninety-Five)
They don't even know me but (BlackBird)
When you feel alone
I'll be calling you (Pour ceux qui savent que c'est vrai c'que j'dis)
I'll be calling you

[Couplet 2 : Nekfeu]
J'ai passé mon adolescence à voler secrètement
Si je te disais que je regrette, ce serait te mentir
Maintenant, je sais que tu peux te faire serrer demain
Et rien ne vaut le sentiment de vivre sereinement
La vie n'est qu'une escale, et ton corps n'est qu'un emprunt
Tu te plains, mais pense à la mort parce qu'elle est encore pire
Grosse galère, on escaladait les grilles des immeubles
Afin de s'caler dans les cages d'escalier pour dormir
On était ensemble pour la mettre à l'envers dans tous les endroits
Pour ves-qui la sécurité, faut du sang froid
Je sais le vide que ça laisse en toi
Sans ma plus fidèle amie, je serais sûrement sans toit

[Refrain : Ed Sheeran]

[Couplet 3 : Nekfeu]
Avec mes pèlerins, on faisait qu'emmerder l'monde
Sur le chemin de l'amitié, j'ai fait de belles rencontres
Mais j'ai grandi, pas besoin de t'alerter, m'man
Quand on part dans nos délires, on a l'air tellement cons
J'étais petit quand mes Kabyles m'ont surnommé "Fennec"
S-Crew, 2001, bébé
À l'époque, on n'avait pas besoin de se téléphoner
Pour s’appeler, fallait siffler en-dessous des fenêtres
On s'donne tellement d'trucs, on est quittes
Langage cru quand on prend des cuites
Open bar, on le brûle en équipe
Open mic, on le brûle en équipe
Ma meilleure amie porte le voile, elle est mignonne
J'ouvre pas ma porte à n'importe qui, j'm'en bats les roubignoles
J'mets tous mes potos dans mes clips
Même ceux qui ont des têtes de guignols
On a appris à devenir des hommes
Ici, la vie te cogne à tour de bras
Je me dis qu'il faut qu'on veille les uns sur les autres
Pendant que mes amis dorment autour de moi

[Pont : Ed Sheeran]
I'll be calling you
I'll be calling you
I'll be calling you, ohoho

[Couplet 4 : Nekfeu]
J'ai vu certains de mes reufs ne plus vouloir faire d'effort et s'taire
J'ai vu des vieilles branches partir, et j'ai vu des faux rester
Mon reuf a fui la réalité, j'aimerais l'aider
L'autre jour, j'l'ai surpris en train d'parler seul, il m'a vu et m'a souri comme si d'rien n'était
Y'avait personne pour aider ce frère issu de la jeunesse désœuvrée
Ta mère savait qu'tu la décevrais quand tu disais que t'allais te sevrer
Malgré des parents pieux, tu pars en vrille et t'as touché le fond
C'est plus la prière mais ta casquette qui t'fait des marques sur le front
T'as voulu t'enlever la vie, on aurait pu deviner
Avant d'sauter par la fenêtre, t'avais déjà le regard dans le vide

Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (Uh)
Me and you isn't (No)
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be if I knew how you felt about me? (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]
It could've been right, but I was wrong (Uh)
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone (Yeah)
The part of me that cared inside is gone
And I know that I can't get caught up

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what

'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been (Yeah)
We could've (Damn)

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Remember?
Remember the night in Miami?
First time you put your arms around me
I'm up reminiscin' (Ooh, yeah)
And thinking 'bout you isn't helping
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me
What good it would do if I decide to face the truth

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
It could've been right, but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
You only hit me up when she's not home
And that's why I can't get caught up

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what

What we could've been
What we should've been
If I wasn't, if I wasn't with somebody
If you gotta hide it, what's the point of trying?
I ain't just your friend, no, what's the point of lying?
Tryna sell a story ain't nobody buyin'
Look me in my eyes, don't that feel nice?
Why should it end? Baby, I could've been
I could've been him, more than your friend
Just say where and when, where to make a trip
Baby, make a wish, be the one I'm with
Should’ve been a, should've, could've, would have been, ayy
Yeah, I would have been (Damn)

They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I’m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together

Pick myself up off the ground

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through

Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

[Hook: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

For my own (to call my own, baby)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

For my own (to call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 4]
Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…

Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart, (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Drink of the apple pie with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
I've got [censored] but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers but when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Interlude: Robert Ontenient]
Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto
Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I see you peekin’ through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I’ll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
"Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!"
"Ooh, yeah, this important!"
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep ya mouth where the money at

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is heal you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now

Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred  bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me; "Nigga"
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different
I would grow to see the difference
Second guessing my decisions, black bodies come up missing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes that I own, I ain't start yet, I ain't start yet

Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics

It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby

Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it

I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal

Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

It's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you ever called, I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to, yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again, just for a day, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Outro]
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left
Oh, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love

Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–

To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you

All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: bearface]
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back

Yeah, yeah, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missing now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missin now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)

Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and stayin' out, don't wanna say goodbye

But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

And alright, alright, alright

24 years in the making
Moving from place to place and
I never really settled down
Without a place to call home

Moving from stranger to strangest
You should face it
I am crazy

And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]

Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

Couldn't break us down

Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (High)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

You're the love of my life but you leavin' me hurt
See the pain in your eyes but I did to you worse
My love never dies, multiplied to the third
She ridin' with me, and I'm being honest
If you fuckin' with us, got the crew behind us

Only foreign women, no Americanas

Dime que te gusta y te veo mañana

Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?

Not a thing in my name

Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

Good luck on them 20 somethings, good luck on them 20 somethings

And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the alternative is an abyss, is just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control, and that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

How do you  feel?

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[Verse 1]
Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be
If you were not surrounding me with your energy
I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere
Anyplace that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Verse 2]
It's the things that you say
It's the way that you prey
Prey on my insecurities
I know you're feelin' me
I know sometimes I do wrong
But hear the words of this song
When I go I don't stay gone for long
Don't know what's going on

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

And I'm coming back home to you

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Intro: Diddy]
I'm back where I belong (Yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I hear the "Tears of a Clown," uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Tell the world that I'm coming home (Yeah)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday (Ain't no more pain)
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Diddy]
“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I'm almost home, check this out
“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away (Feels so good)
All the pain of yesterday (Feels so free)
I know my kingdom awaits (Ain't no place like home, baby)
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Ain't no place like home)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

[Chorus 3]
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Oh just forget what I said, I just be thinkin' out loud
Thinkin' out loud, thinkin' out loud

My neck is retarded, but nigga, I'm geeked
My bitch is a baller, but she from the streets
So don't get her started
Handcuffs like I got arrested homie
Ferragamo's on me, got me flexin' on 'em
Mud, mud, I got all these taxes on me
Diamonds shinin', that's them VVS's on me
Leanin' off Activis (Ah)
Tippin' on fours, thinkin' 'bout when them hoes used to sleep on me like mattresses (Mattresses)
But that's how it go, now I'm gettin' that dough, and I'm 'bout to count up like it's calculus (Calculus)

I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, oooh

On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return (let it burn)

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

You lose, you lose

Woo, child, tired of the bullshit

Wan' spend the day and flex on me
Put a curse and hex on me
Scratch out my name, put the X on me
You should come check on me
Talk dirty and caress on me
Fuck it, might as well get undressed for me
Love how you get that pussy wet for me
Put a lot of stress on me
You used to obsess for me
Call the station and request for me
You done went and got a big head on me

[Chorus]
You're running me dry
Oh girl, you're running me dry
Cried my last tear drop
Saw bad when I told her "Bring it here"
Drop down, pick it up, up, up
Swing it around, I'ma go, go, go
Drop that, down, I'ma pick it up, up, up
Swing it around, I'ma go, go, go

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to break my neck for you
Spend my paycheck on you
Put my account in the red for you
Damn near put myself in debt for you
You made me obsessed for you
Thought I had the same effect on you
Couldn't see I was the best for you
Now you gotta figure out what's next for you
Now you feel regret, oh, do you?
Baby, I could care less for you
Trust, I'm not even sweating you
You ran me dry, bet it gets to you (Oh yeah)
Out of respect for you
I curved bitches on the internet for you
I lost all respect for you
Baby, it's my turn to flex on you

I know a lot of people but I don't fuck with a lot
Got me standing here when I just wanna leave the spot
Thinking 'bout a whip and man I might just cop the drop
Just so they could think I'm friendly when I'm not
Arm out the window like yessir (Yessir)
Right good, working on my left bruh
Man I got my shit together then I stepped up
I got tired of niggas telling me I'm next up
Old label wasn't talking 'bout nothing
Meanwhile, I'm getting ready for a run
I ain't sitting, I ain't talking, I ain't hustling with you niggas
Fuck around and y'all gon' make me push a button on you niggas, ay
I got a baby on the way (Baby on the way)
I think about it every day (I think about it every day)
They think that paper gon' change me
I do this shit for my baby
I do this shit for my niggas
And we go way back just like crack in the muhfuckin' 80's
This flow is crazy, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, nigga this flow is crazy
I don't fear no man or no object
Bullfighter, I've been working on my sidestep
I know preparation gets you through the process
Look at all the progress

If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know, ay

[Verse 2]
I would never know
Worked on this shit till I was a pro
Ran through these streets, ran through these beats
Ran through these thoughts, ran through these hearts
I was in the dark till I caught a spark
Feel like I'm on fire, get too close, make a nigga die
They cannot be I, it's too hard, they could probably try
They could try, I'm on I-20 tryna get to 85
My girl mad but she don't want another guy
I wonder why?
Wait, no I don't
Work real hard and I get what I want
This is for them days we ain't eat
This is for them nights we ain't sleep
Going through beat after beat now
I could probably make 100 songs in my sleep
Yeah-yeah

Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach

And um, I must look amazing with you

Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'

Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty, have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

Yeah and a freak mind is divine so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs, I eat up
Why do, why do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man that bitch so cold, man that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You're the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before
I need you more than keys need doors
I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm
Yeah and I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you're, my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl you so lonely, will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care
God is fair

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think "what a cute guy" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.

[Intro]
Dubba-AA flex
Drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
Movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
This is the sound

[Verse 1]
They say Kentrell got a baby, he ain't nothin' but thirteen
They told me that he needed love, he couldn't pay for what he need
They said he said he don't feel love and he so caught in these streets
They say he plottin' to kill himself because he just wanna leave
Plus he ain't happy with himself 'cause what he want he can't keep
He feel like he won't make it out because his problems too deep
He had a shootout in the south, his friend got hit with that heat
He startin' to have some crazy thoughts, he put tattoos on his sleeve
He got one tatted by his eye, it symbolizes Nene
He swear to never tell no lie 'cause that's not what he believe
He keep a pistol when he ride but still feel like he gon' leave
They say that girl not on his side because he gave her herpes

[Chorus]
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby

[Verse 2]
They say his misstress walked in on him, he was playin' with some fire
They say he mentioned to his nigga he might blow out his mind
Say he been lookin' real suspicious, they can tell he been cryin'
They say he steady waitin' on somethin', he keep his eyes on the time
They hear the headphones on his head playin' Luther Vandross, baby (sayin this home not a home)
They read his wall it was written up in hand he got a dead soul, baby
They say he headed onto the land to hear his grandma call, baby
He said they don't understand who I am, they all think I'm goin' crazy

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say go get that out his hand, he on the porch with a choppa
They say he took like seven Xans, he say he's helpin' his problems
He say he cannot trust a girl, he got no love for his momma
And he got used while he was up, he feel he back at the bottom
They say his body actin' up, he don't want go to the doctor
They say they see he givin' up, he don't want no talk 'bout no dollar
His only trust is for to run because his past gon' follow
They say this nigga dressin' crazy, he won't put down his collar

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, baby

Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to come off aggressive (no)
I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)

I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

Girl, this is crazy... let me tell you

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
I can't believe all of the things they say about me
Walk in the room they throwing shade left to right
They be like, "Ooh, she serving face"
And I just tell 'em cut me up and get down
They call us dirty cause we break all your rules down
And we just came to act a fool, is that all right? (Girl, that's alright)
They be like, "Ooh, let them eat cake."
But we eat wings and throw them bones on the ground

[Hook: Janelle Monáe]
Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm cutting up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be Queen

[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
Is it peculiar that she twerk in the mirror?
And am I weird to dance alone late at night?
And is it true we're all insane?
And I just tell 'em, "No we ain't" and get down
I heard this life is just a play with no rehearsal
I wonder will this be my final act tonight
And tell me what's the price of fame?
Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground?

[Hook: Janelle Monáe]
Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm cutting up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be Queen

[Verse 3: Janelle Monáe]
Hey brother can you save my soul from the devil?
Say is it weird to like the way she wear her tights?
And is it rude to wear my shades?
Am I a freak because I love watching Mary? (Maybe)
Hey sister am I good enough for your heaven?
Say will your God accept me in my black and white?
Will he approve the way I'm made?
Or should I reprogram, deprogram and get down?

[Hook: Janelle Monáe]
Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm cutting up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be Queen

I will love who I am

[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
Ohh, shake 'til the break of dawn
Don't mean to sing so tough, I can't take it no more
Baby, me and tuxedo groove
Pharaohs and E. Badu
Crazy in the black and white
We got the drums so tight
Baby, here comes your freedom song
Too strong, we moving on
Baby, this melody will show you another way
Been 'droids for far too long
Come home and sing your song
But you gotta testify, because the booty don't lie
No, no, the booty don't lie; oh no, the booty don't lie

[Spoken: Janelle Monáe]
Yeah.. yeah, let's flip it
I don't think they understand what I'm trying to say
Haha, yeah, uh, I asked a question like this:

[Outro: Janelle Monáe]
"Are we a lost generation of our people?
Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal
She who writes the movie owns the script and the sequel
So why ain't the stealing of my rights made illegal?
They keep us underground working hard for the greedy
But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy
My crown too heavy like the Queen Nefertiti
Gimme back my pyramid, I'm trying to free Kansas City
Mixing masterminds like your name Bernie Grundman
Well I'mma keep leading like a young Harriet Tubman
You can take my wings but I'm still gonna fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah, I'ma keep sangin', I'mma keep writin' songs
I'm tired of Marvin asking me "What's Going On?"
March through the streets 'cuz I'm willing and I'm able
Categorize me, I defy every label
And while you're selling dope, we're gonna keep selling hope
We rising up now, you gotta deal you gotta cope
Will you be electric sheep? Electric ladies, will you sleep?
Or will you preach?"

No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can, though

[Verse 1]
I'm as humble as they come, but you're fucking with the wrong one
Boy you're fucking with the wrong one
This that new Pen Griffey,  watch that nigga get a home run
Watch him hit it, that's a home run
I ain't playin' wit' you nigga's
I'm a true Louis Villain
I'm the realest, they acrylic
Fuck them niggas if they doubt it
Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter
I've been getting up, 'bout pay my self allowance
And I save it like the bell, I can't take no more L's
The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell
Been putting on a show, just like Dave, I'm Chappelle
They ain't make it in the credits, I'ma tell them oh well
Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel
Niggas gotta get the work, girl unless you gon' twerk something
While I lay this verse on em'
Damn this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it, I'm just saying nigga (Young Tiller)

This ain't temporary, I've been out here letting them know
New cat, years later, bet Sylvester Stallone
I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know
Peep the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them, no
She chose me over him, cause he was so regular, oh
He was so regular, I'm like a butler getting his dough
I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking Predator
Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra
I don't fuck with thotties, I pass them to my partner
All gold everything, bitch I'm Fort Knoxin'
New sports car man
I'm new Porsche coppin', two door hop in
Girl you know how I spend
And I've been trying to budget my checks and the rest of my money, money
Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds
M.V.P upper deck with the money, money
Don't I make the haters upset with the money
Bitch, I'm coming cause

I lost it all, my friends, my loved ones
But in life there's always a chance to grow
From the struggle, from the pain, from the realness
Here's my story, Lloyd

[Verse 1]
Hey world, yeah I know it's been a while
Thought I'd come around to let you know what's up now
No album lately so my mind is kinda up-down
I still been taking care my mama and them somehow
Disappeared from the scene and left my old team
Had to find a new approach to an old dream
And it's not to take a shot at my old team
I just want you to see

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Verse 2]
Apologies if I ever let you down
But so much shit done happen that it's hard to talk about
So many lawsuits that my lawyer said don't talk about it
Just had to breathe, keep it cool 'til I can walk up out it
Came home helped my sister raise a child
Kinda hurt me cause I could've had my own now
Lost my baby damn it's really hitting home now
I just had to learn

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Bridge]
I look up to the sky, Lord why do I cry
When no one is looking, is the blame for this pain
Even caused by the shame of this fame I've been given
My pride don't cause me to hide my true feelings
Cause I can only be real
Cause I can only be real

[Chorus]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true
Alright, alright
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true
And all I wanna be is true

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook]
I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow

Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Hook]
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (Well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride

You can be the peanut butter to my jelly
You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
You can be the captain and I can be your first mate
You can be the chills that I feel on our first date
You can be the hero and I can be your sidekick
You can be the tear that I cry if we ever split
You can be the rain from the cloud when it's stormin'
Or you can be the sun when it shines in the mornin'

Don't know if I could ever be
Without you cause boy you complete me
And in time I know that we'll both see
That we're all we need

You're the straw to my berry
You're the smoke to my high
And you're the one I wanna marry

You can be the prince and I can be your princess
You can be the sweet tooth and I can be the dentist
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
You can be the heart that I spill on the pages
You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser
You can be the pencil and I can be the paper
You can be as cold as the winter weather
But I don't care as long as we're together

[Verse 3: Drake]
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need

Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about

You thought you had a fool, that's cool
You went behind my back, that's cool
But I can play this game like you
If he a dog, bitch, I'm a dog too
Ain't nobody got it like me
Did you forget that all these niggas like me?
And they'd be lucky to let me be wifey
So how could you be so damn triflin'?
When you hear about the dirt that I've done
You gon' be so fuckin' hurt cause I'm the one
You thought that you could just go out and have your fun
But I can play the same game except I won

[Pre-Chorus]
Two wrongs don't make it right
But I'd be damned if I don't put up a fight
You say I'm wrong cause I cheated outta spite
I say you wrong cause you cheated every night

[Chorus]
So, if he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you

[Verse 2]
Two can play this game you call love
If you loved me then you wouldn't be a dog
If you loved me then you wouldn't creep at all
If this is love, then this ain't what I want
So you do you, and I'ma do me
No sense in playing with each others' feelings
But every time I try to go, you beg me not to leave
So what the hell am I supposed to think?
When you love someone, you pray that they will change
But you soon accept they'll always be the same
And they'll always try to treat you like a lame
So in return you treat them the same way

[Pre-Chorus]
Two wrongs don't make it right
But I'd be damned if I don't put up a fight
You say I'm wrong cause I cheated outta spite
I say you wrong cause you cheated every night

[Chorus]
So, if he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you

If he a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog

If there's one thing that I learned
While in those county lines
It's that everything takes time
You have gotta lose your pride
You have gotta lose your mind
Just to find your peace of mind
You have got to trust the signs
Everything will turn out fine

So why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the world when you're chasing the win

There's really no real, there's really no pretending
There's really no fail, there's really no winning
Cause nothing really is, and everything really isn't

My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Uh-uh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Ah-huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Outro: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Haha)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh oh oh-oh (To my stereo) (Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh, oh-oh (It's your boy, Travie)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh

I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win"

Because I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

Young man, there's no need to feel down
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

[Hook]
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A

You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you want to be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams
But you got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A
I'm sure they can help you today

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That's when someone came up to me
And said, young man, take a walk up the street
There's a place there called the Y.M.C.A
They can start you back on your way

T'es rentré dans ma vie comme dans un freestyle
T'as voulu qu'on s'évade comme Bonnie & Clyde
J'ai voulu percer ton cœur en titane
J'ai vite compris que j'n'étais pas de taille
Baby, alors? On va où? On fait quoi?
On s'enfuit, loin d'ici, on y va
On est si différents, c'est ce qui nous attire
"Bang, bang, bang!" Autour ça tire
Viens avec moi si t'es prête a partir
J'veux pas rester là, ils veulent nous asservir
Baby, alors? On va où? On fait quoi?
On s'enfuit, loin d'ici, on y va

Il m'a eu (oh), mais je n'ose pas lui dire qu'il compte pour moi
Je l'avoue (oh), qu'il en faut plus pour partir avec moi
Même si au fond je le veux, eh, prends les devants et fais-moi rêver
Oui j'ai réuni toutes mes affaires, on va où? On fait quoi? On s'enfuit
On s'en va sans pour autant tout foutre en l'air, une voix me dit "non n'y va pas"
D'un côté, j ai peur d'me tromper sur lui mais d'un autre, je sais qu'il m'a conquise
Bon on y va, si ça n'va pas, je m'en mordrai les doigts

Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it, babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days

But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl, I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out

Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

See what you doing, girl?

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Verse 1]
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said "let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

[Hook]
I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

[Bridge]
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you

[Outro]
So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you?
It’s all good now
Goodbye now
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever

My comrades want them bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want that tri, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah, we need more than racks, my comrades want them 'illions

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Bet you never see my niggas pull up to the spot
I just signed so many checks my wrist about to pop
If you ever talk about me when I'm not around
Your girl'll probably tell me when I put it in her mouth
(When I put it in her mouth)
Put your wallet in your pocket, bitch, you playing
(Bitch, you playing)
Even when I wasn't on, I'm always paying
(You know who's paying)
Went from hipsters, now it's models and these singers (On the low)
And my hair be growing like a fuckin' Saiyan (Ooh)
I popped a couple pills, I think that I'm Devante
I fuck a bitch from Lost and Found like every Monday (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
My jawline so defined, I'm wildin' like I'm Gunplay (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You see no white inside my eyes and it's a fun day
But when I'm workin', girl, I'm workin' for the millions (Workin' for the millions)
Girl, when I'm workin', I be workin' for them billions (Ooh yeah)
Why your hand out, I ain't trickin', find another sucka'
These bitches tryna make a livin', but

You know I been on now, then, and I'm next
Every year my year, you know I always wanna flex

[Verse 3: Future]
Say my, say my, say my name
Switchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
Avianne draped me up, nigga
Yellow bones suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate, but she call me Papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hottie thotty
Put them heels to her nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell a nigga, a nigga never did exist
You niggas never never been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Been provin', you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

[Outro: Swae Lee]
If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little motherfuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes, then y'all go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead

She said, "Leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother
I got bloodstains on the bed
And I ain't sayin' that I love her
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone

[Verse 2]
I worship since I met you
I fell down to my knees
And when no one would accept ya
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed
I seen a dark cloud coming over

But she rode me like no other
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Ah, whatever goes around
Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful, baby
And look both ways
Before you cross my mind

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
Did you ever wonder, yeah, do you ever wonder?
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone (Sometimes it hurts baby)
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just ain't the same on the phone, no
But everybody's gotta go on, don't they?
Yes, we do, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out, nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough but winners don't quit
So don't you give up, the sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endlessly
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's when the flowers bloom

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Kali, what you mean? I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, -brella (-brel-la)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry, 'cause you drive me candy
The Tito to my Randy, now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh

The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough

Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm...

I know it's hard

I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary (diary)
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see (see)
Hope to see you with me 'cause...

My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up

But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, grippin' and biting
Remember the times after fighting
You said you loved me, I liked it
Became obsessed with the sexing
You screaming, “Whose is it?” we naked
Now I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feeling’s real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't
But that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring, just hold it down ,be supportive
I'll be back in the morning, that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it
Ain't the same, better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one (oh, for you)
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up (oh, made mistakes, I know I fucked up)

But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl, I'm 'bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my...

Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon’ be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)

About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold
I'll be thinking about you
About you

[Verse 1]
Seconds from my heart
A bullet from the dark
Helpless, I surrender
Shackled by your love
Holding me like this
With poison on your lips
Only when it's over
The silence hits so hard

'Cause it was almost love, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

We bleed ourselves in vain
How tragic is this game?
Turn around, I'm holding on to someone
But the love is gone
Carrying the load, with wings that feel like stone
Knowing that we nearly fell so far now
It's hard to tell

Yeah we came so close, it was almost love
It was almost love, it was almost love

When the walls were caving in
But I see you on the other side
We can try all over again

About you
When my skin grows old
When my breath runs cold

Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine them and I like thim slick
Thim slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony pint over the ledge
Been a few days, but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
Not to save hoes or rescue anybody
But a nigga know what stress do to the body
And I done seen you in your best shoes but Zanotti's
Shit be looking like fresh shoes on Bugatti's
And I don't know who invented high heels
But I swear we all owe him one
And if you do know that man, girl
I be like ''where you know him from?''
You so slick, so small, curvy
Teeth all pearly, hair all curly
Was a Tom Boy, now you all girly
Never look tired, but you wake up all early
Hit the gym, keep it toned up
Progress pic, holding your phone up
Aw shit, waist getting smaller
Niggas on Instagram like ''damn, I need to call her''

[Chorus: Jeremih (Fabolous)]
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just fine
You got that blessing in disguise
You wouldn't know it, girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(Thim slick girls could get every dime) girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(Thim slick girls could get every dime)  girl you got me

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She like ''hold up, let me throw on something light'' (damn)
Bitch really went and threw on something tight (haha)
Came downstairs in her Superwoman tights like
''Dida dida, dida dida dida''
Damn, I ain't know you was holding like that
I ain't know brown skin Kelly Rowland like that
Never knew you had it with your sneaky ass
She said ''I never seen you looking with your peaking ass''
34, 24, 36
Finally got a selfie after taking thirty pics
36, 24, 40
D-cups, caption, double cup shorty
And it's angles to this shit, angles to this shit
Gotta hold her phone up and put the angle on the pics
And then they poke it out and put an angle on that hip
Having thirsty niggas come from every angle at that bitch
Lord, Heard when they thinner you get deeper in her
They say when they thicker they make you cum quicker
(Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime)
That ass in the gym, squat life
Gotta show 'em love in the era of the shot life
This is all from my mama, this is not knife
Niggas love her shit, give a fuck about likes

[Chorus: Jeremih (Fabolous)]
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just fine
You got that blessing in disguise
You wouldn't know it, girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me
(Thim slick girls could get every dime) girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time) girl you got me

Deep until I know I pleased that body body

And make you wanna tell somebody body

Or maybe we can float on top my water bed?
You close your eyes as I improv' between your legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves, and tables
Girl you know I'm more than able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and hours on the bed

“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…"

[Intro: 2Pac]
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A., California
What you say about Los Angeles?
Still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka burned out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing

[Outro: 2Pac]
This go out for 92.3 and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells quatruple quitraple platinum
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
All the real motherfuckers
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all mothafuckers
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
L.A., "California Love" part mothafuckin' two
Without gay ass Dre
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)

I was tryna  get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I wanna pull up, head spin
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said "Grind harder"
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Gun in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Me and the woman I love on an air mattress
We share a cot, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Stale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them "Get lost"
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with
Shorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash

Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Ain't never change, been like this from the start
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve

[Intro: 2Pac]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream "Peace!" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)

[Verse 1]
Always felt like I needed to please her, or impress her
Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that "I love you"
But I really, really, really fucking don't
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sitting down in the shower, girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine now I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
Do you prioritise the things in your life
The things that you hope to do
Cause if not, then
Mate, you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgetting about yourself
Because of one fucking girl
She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me, no
But no
Neither of us will get down from the shelf
The only one she loves is herself

As a matter of fact, I'm happy for you
I'm glad you found your way

You were the one to see me

Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko
From Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who want to ride it? Won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm big, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, Chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

[Chorus: Joe & Big Pun]
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas
Uptown, baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck tonight?

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep
Pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, ‘cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

[Bridge: Big Pun & Joe]
In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love
Got you screamin', "Punish me!"
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like
"Don't stop, get it, get it!"
In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love
Got you screamin', "Punish me!"
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like
"Don't stop, get it, get it!"

[Chorus: Joe & Big Pun]
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas
Uptown, baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck tonight?

You’re broken down and tired

First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

And my bank account is looking mighty fine, ayy

What happened here ain't nothing sacred
Shit that got me fucked up is

Nursing a broken heart
But who'd've thought it'd take me ages?
I ended up here 'cause my girl said, "Fake it 'til you make it"

I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself

What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete

Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side

Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Verse 1]
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh

Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...

[Verse 2]
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Gasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? and boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind

When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohh, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye

Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time

Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time

I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz

And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute

Thuggin', so fuck your opinion

Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliette

Wake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love then and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
Yeah

What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make everything all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
Right

What I am trying to say is
The love is our to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies, yeah
Awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork

I wanna feel the light, pushin' our limits
Unbuckled for the ride, mhmm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night
If the light is in the air
Open, finally
We're going and we're free

My girl's at the door
And I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (goin' back)

We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me the look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?

A certified dime piece, deserve Louis one three
One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank, woah, oh-ooh, woah
And then I'ma take you home with me

Mmm, ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, these niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back, I'm just tryna protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger

Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
