[Verse 1]
25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

[Verse 2]
And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution

And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah

Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh

[Verse 2]
Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh

[Verse 3]
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out
Hush

[Outro]
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count ’em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep


Start of song 


[Intro]
(Radio...)
(Radio...)

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

All we hear is Radio ga ga

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And if I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land (yeah, haha haha)

I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Start of song 


Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 1]
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Interlude]
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

[Verse 3]
Somebody once asked
Could I spare some change for gas?
"I need to get myself away from this place"
I said, "Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change"

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Start of song 


It took
One look
And forever lay out in front of you

One smile
Then I die
But it will be revived by you

There I was
Thought I had everything
Figured out
Goes to show just how much I know
Bout the way life plays out

Chorus:
I take one step away
And I find myself coming back
To you
My one and only
One and only
You

Now I know
That I know not a thing at all
Except the fact that I am yours
And that you are mine

Oh
If you told me that it wouldn't be easy
And Oh
I'm not one to complain

Chorus:
I take one step away
And I find myself coming back
To you
My one and only
One and only

I take one step away
And I find myself coming back

My one and only
One and only

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in love, I won't let you control what I want

Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love

Hey you, you, why? You, you, you

[Verse 1]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Hook]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Hook]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world, mad world
Enlarging your world, mad world

Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Verse 2: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & DØVES]
Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines

[Verse 3: DØVES]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (Tryin' so hard)
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?!"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

[Bridge]
An' I can't see you here, wonderin' where  am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
An' you're startin' to bore me, baby
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

"Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)

Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up

Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up

Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

[Verse 2]
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

I don't want to close my eyes

I don't want to miss one kiss
Well, I just want to be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just want to hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah!

Don't want to close my eyes

Join in my—
Join in, my child, and listen
Digging through
My old numb shadow

[Verse 1]
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles, looking for a clue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding

[Chorus 1]
In my shadow
My shadow
Change is coming through
My shadow
My shadow
Shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again

Join in my child
My shadow's
Closer to meaning

Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
Insecure delusions
I wanna feel the change consume me
Feel the outside turning in
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in

[Chorus 2]
My shadow
My shadow
Change is coming
Now is my time
Listen to my muscle memory
Contemplate what I've been clinging to
Forty-six and two ahead of me

[Bridge]
I choose to live and to grow
Take and give and to move
Learn and love and to cry
Kill and die and to be
Paranoid and to lie
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through
I choose to live and to lie
Kill and give and to die
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through

See my shadow changing
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow
Forty six and two are just ahead of me

Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know

Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Truth be told
I've been there, I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?

So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me

On the Rorschach sheets where we make love

Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in "I-told-you-so" voice:
"It’s just how we expected"

Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I’ll send a bitch to get ya, so don’t play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I’ll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she’s sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I’m out the door, it’s monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck—another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, but it’ll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it

[Outro: Matt Champion]
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on ya

Who are you to wave your finger?
You must've been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead
Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around
You must've been high
You must've been high
You must've been

Foot in mouth and head up ass
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy
You must've been so high
You must've been so high

Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high
You must've been high, high

Who are you to wave your finger? So full of it
Eye balls deep in muddy waters, fuckin' hypocrite
Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me what's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
You must have been out your mind

Weepin' shades of indigo
Shed without a reason
Weepin' shades of indigo

Liar, lawyer, mirror for ya, what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned, he's guilty as the government
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high, high, high

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
You're balls deep in muddy waters
Ganja? Please!
You must have been out your mind

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD? My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me? My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
(What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line
(Please stay with me) Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again?
(Me) What's my age again?

[Verse]
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind to it all
And my mind and my gun they comfort me
Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell on this earth forevermore
Still, I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
But I can't walk on the path of the right because I'm wrong
Well, I came upon a man at the top of a hill
Called himself the savior of the human race
Said he come to save the world from destruction and pain
But I said, "How can you save the world from itself?"

[Outro]
'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind
Oh, and I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
But I know when I die my soul is damned

Young man, there's no need to feel down
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

[Hook]
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

[Verse 2]
Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you want to be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams
But you got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A
I'm sure they can help you today

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That's when someone came up to me
And said, young man, take a walk up the street
There's a place there called the Y.M.C.A
They can start you back on your way

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A

Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground
Y.M.C.A....you'll find it at the Y.M.C.A
No man, no man does it all by himself
Young man, young man, put your pride on the shelf
Y.M.C.A....just go to the Y.M.C.A
Young man, young man, are you listening to me?
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?
Y.M.C.A....you find in the Y.M.C.A....
No man, no man does it all by himself

Young man, young I was down with the blues

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find

Your feelings changed like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on without falling apart?
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind

[Chorus]
Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

[Verse 2]
Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds

You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

[Chorus]
Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command?

I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there

I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there

I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

Follow me into, into my sleep
Baby I'm yours, I'm yours to keep
You've got the magic
That entered my heart and my mind

Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand?
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand...?

[Verse 1]
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Outro]
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?

The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head (Hahahahahahaha!)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
You rearrange me till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there's someone in my head but it's not me

You shout and no one seems to hear

It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around


Start of song 


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

[Chorus 1]
So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

[Verse 2]
I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

[Chorus 2]
So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

[Guitar solo]

Oh, oh

[Chorus 3]
So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my—

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head

What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Verse 2]
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
But it don't sound much like you, girl

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)

Say something once, why say it again?

Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line

[Chorus 1]
And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong

[Verse 2]
We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day, we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there

[Chorus 2]
And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone
We're setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this home

[Post-Chorus]
And you caused it
And you caused it
And you caused it

[Bridge]
Well, I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette
I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget
And my eyes are damp from the words you left
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

[Chorus 3]
And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

Clubbidubbin, mine damer e så stunning
Kanskje vi e litt ufyslige
Men ka gjør det når det'sje lenger e dag

Dem står aleine men vi gjør det ilag

[Verse 1]
I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion
But it wasn't hate for once
Yes I'm changing, yes I'm gone
Yes I'm older, yes I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime
You can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do

[Chorus]
So don't be blue
There is another future
Waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change
But that's bullshit, they do
Yes I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself
I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there
And it's calling my name

And it's calling yours, girl
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too

Arise and walk on through

A world beyond that door is calling out for you

Arise and walk, come through
A world beyond that door

But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off

You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

Does anybody want to take it anymore?

Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking

Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Intro]
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

[Chorus]
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 1]
The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head

[Verse 2]
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

[Bridge]
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman

I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath

Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

I don't want to hear you got a boyfriend
Sometimes you're better off alone
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't ever want to be your boyfriend

Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

A soft sound to the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a let down, I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

[Verse 2]
A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you
You're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I’m spillin' my guts
She wants to know, am I still a slut?
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it’s born again

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever had
How long

Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear

I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

If I choose then I lose

[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Verse 2]
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many, Bonnies blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace and maybe someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, hot, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're crumbling, sadly

You are unfixable
I can't break through your world

Your heart is unbreakable

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

Obey your master

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now, your life is out of season

I will run through you, now I rule you too

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

A job that slowly kills you

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

Take me back to the night we met

What the hell I'm supposed to do

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

Some turn to dust or to gold

Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some turn to dust or to gold

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some turn to dust or to gold

Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality

High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most

The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stone
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

They danced through the day and into the night
Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again
'Til the walls did crumble and fall

Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

He was six-foot-four and full of muscles
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich

Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah

Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock

When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop

Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, wow

[Verse: Kanye West]
So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's... mine!

One minute, and then the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's—

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

[Chorus 1]
Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

[Chorus 2]
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose, and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

[Verse 3]
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

[Chorus 3]
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy

All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it’s alright
For me to come out

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives) And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta get to rock bottom (Oof!)

[Verse 2]
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain’t coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I’ll come alive

[Chorus]
(Hard times) Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times) Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry

We'll kick it when I hit the ground

[Verse 1]
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 2]
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

[Verse 3]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 4]
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
‘Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

Find my back in the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm caught in it again, see 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long, ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin’ out nowhere, where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, everytime I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

[Verse]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught
If your CD's on fire you had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dog
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
Widely regarded highly? Bite me, sweetheart
I'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'
Shit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
On some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement
'Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
Toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
Looking skantless as Hannibal's stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis
Gallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers
I bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
No underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mixing
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Fin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches
Swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
But it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
That I'm battering all shatter and fall
'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables
Hooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
And I'll catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack like Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door's laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five-finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
("Em") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth
And have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's "Control" verse
And perform "Fack" in concert ["Fack" plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
Still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "Monster"
So do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
Everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio
(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That my disguise is pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula, Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna

Many days fell away with nothing to show

[Verse 1]
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

[Verse 2]
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah

The look of love, the rush of blood
The "She's with me"s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the color dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've got to let me go

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

[Bridge]
Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer

[Build-up]
You've got to let me know

[Chorus]
Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

[Outro]
Are we human or are we dancer?
Are we human or are we dancer?

[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can’t relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

[Bridge]
(Yo, bring it on down)

I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

Can't make it all alone

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)

Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?

You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 2]
Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me "Lip Parade"
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice

Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I’ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

Well, I remember!
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced

So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Breakdown]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?

[Outro]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And are you lonely
Looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 1]
Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet, before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you

[Verse 2]
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

[Bridge]
I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say good-bye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Verse 3]
Time is racing toward us, till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order, and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse 1]
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Verse 1]
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

[Chorus]
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 2]
Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 3]
Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

[Chorus 2]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess

If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob (good pity)

Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?

See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”

This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)

Legends never die when the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

[Verse 1]
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

[Verse 2]
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die, they become a part of you

Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more

Legends never die, they become a part of you

That is circling all round the sun

Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see

In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me

Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

[Bridge]
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

[Verse 4]
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see

You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
A new car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
And don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Saxophone Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...

[Spoken Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

[Verse 1]
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

[Verse 1]
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner
With the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally
Rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the
24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin'
Even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house
Wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook
I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the
24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin'
Even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house
Wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Post-Chorus]
The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Interlude: Josh Homme]
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

[Intro]
American love, American me, American you
American tear, American heartbreak, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with

[Chorus]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law

[Verse 2]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy, fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"

[Chorus]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce

[Verse 3]
Well, you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh, if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do

[Intro: Maitre Gims]
On prétend pas être des modèles pour les gosses
Ni pour personne d'autre !
On tient juste à dire que... le pont qui mène au succès
Est un pont fragile

[Couplet 1: Maître Gims]
J'ai demandé pardon sans qu'on puisse me l'accorder
J'ai demandé ma route sans qu'on puisse me l'indiquer
J'ai troqué mes études contre un disque de platine
Tout en sachant qu'tôt ou tard ton public te piétines
J'ai vu les choses en grand, j'ai du cran, j'ai du talent
Je reste sur mes gardes, je n'suis qu'un homme
Ça capture mon image dans des 7D Canon
Tout ça j'le fais pour moi, ceux qui doutent et la daronne
J'ai pété les plombs ! (J'ai pété les plombs)
J'ai quitté l'école ! (J'ai quitté l'école)
Si seulement tu savais (Si seulement tu savais)
Tout le mal que je garde (Tout le mal que je garde)

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
C'est ma direction !
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

[Couplet 2: Lefa]
J'ai fuis les sonneries, les bruits d'chaises
Moi j'cherchais d'autre style de richesses
Du journal d'Anne Frank à c'lui d'Bridget
J'ai jamais kiffé lire depuis qu'jai
12 piges, malgré les ratures j'gratte le papier
C'est ma direction, j'me suis pas éparpillé
Plaqué plus d'une fois, dos au re-mu
Trop fier pour demander d'l'aide au RMI
Les shabs en guise de mif, l'estrade en guise de but
Freiné par les fils de chhhut...
J'me souviens qu'à la base on voulait même pas toucher d'blé
Ça rappait sale quand on s'entassait tous chez le Blanc
Tu connais BatiPro, Crit, Selpro
J’écrivais dans l'trom avant d'aller m'casser l'dos
Aujourd'hui tout ça n'aurais pas d'sens
Sans tous ces sacrifices, sans toute cette patience

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
C'est ma direction !
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

[Couplet 3: Maska]
J'me remémore les clashs, les concours de rap, la hass
Dans la rue ça rappe en masse, ça zappe même d'aller nehess
Pour un 16 mes gars t'agressent, seul le kickage nous apaise
Nos voix, nos mains s'élèvent quand les flics sales nous rabaissent
Le rêve est à nos pieds donc on dort tête bêche
On baigne dans les richesses mais nos lèvres restent sèches
J'veux vivre de ma passion car tous les taffs me déplaisent
On cherchait que la reconnaissance on voulait pas parler d'espèces
Maintenant on fout dehors la hass même si nos passés l'heberge
Ca veut acheter des caisses, attaquer l'marché des States
Si on a autant ramé, c'est pour être stock à l'arrivée
Pour bien steaker les stre-mon qui voulaient nous faire chavirer
Mais ça taf j'ai quitté pour mieux déplacer des montagnes
Résultat, ma foi baisse, mes fautes sont indénombrables
Cherche pas trop la lumière, le soleil brûle ta peau
Ouais le succès te fume, à peine tu l'crapotes

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
C'est ma direction !
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

[Couplet 4: Barack Adama]
Fuck le taff... un bac pro ça paye pas
Avec les srabs, pour le rap bah on veille tard
Malgré les découverts, les sales patrons
J'ai tout plaqué à la conquêtes des salles, partons !
Un projet suicidaire, ça passe ou on se casse
Et tu nous suis si t'aimes akhi
Determinés, on part au front sans armure
Et les plus terre-à-terre disent qu'on foncent dans un mur (Aah!)
Les darons savent pas c'que j'fais, ils disent que j'dors
Ils pensent que leur fiston ne vit que dehors
Sans savoir qu'ce p'tit con prépare des disques d'or
Et tout ceux qui le négligent bah on plus que tort
J'sais où j'vais, sans savoir si j's'rais le bienvenu
J'suis pas invité et j'suis accompagné d'OVNIs
J'me dirige vers la gloire et les blèmes-pro
La musique est une femme à problèmes mais putain j'l'aime trop

[Refrain: Maître Gims]
C'est ma direction !
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Verse 2]
Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing

[Verse 1]
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said...

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Heart wrote the song, but I am the messenger
Through the metropolis
There is no stoppin' this (no, no, no, no)
Flowers and kisses, yeah

Light up the candles
Tune up this channel
It's the ride of your life, girl
My room is Orlando
Bruce G the man, though
How much can you handle?
I go commando (oh)
That body so blanco

And I'm bout dive in it, straight to bottom
'Cause there is no toppin' this, pop lock and drop
On your man if you coppin' it, baby
I fall for these tropical ladies
I know that she wavy, she naughty, she crazy, she got it
She got it all on me – the road is wide open
And callin', I flow like a Lambo
My boo's a Bugatti, I live like a movie
Young opportunist used to make changes
To hang with the coolest, but now I'm the coolest
That dude that will do it, that dude who will fuel
The movement, watch as I do this
I'm good in my lane though
Hand in my hand, no letting go
On top of my game, yeah, on top of my game
I play with an angel

[Bridge]
I'm grateful
Thank you for the things you do and say to keep me faithful
Thank you for the time you take to keep my heart from danger
Funny how one stranger stepped in, made up all these changes
For the better

Oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
Grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
I'm grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
Grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
I'm grateful (oh lord), yeah

I don't really do this but
Bruce G be the dude to remove the bluff
Fake chick wanna talk like she knew what's up
Every time I step in they say, "Who the what?" –
"The where, the how?", fly nigga smear the ground
My chick 10/10, she could steer the sound
From miles away – Hello felt kinda gay
Now goodbyes feel like a tidal wave

[Chorus 2]
You must be three if you ain't the one
'Cause I know three words to replace the sun
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
You must be three if you ain't the one
'Cause I know three words to replace the sun
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run

[Verse 4]
Yeah, this trust never trippin' up
This love ever livin' up
Never had to flex for you
Get fresh, catch a bus just to hit you up
Got me on speed dial
Just press 1 if you really need me now
Press 4 if you miss me
Press 3 and I'll...

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real

I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life
Among the dead

[Verse 3: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Verse 3: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 4: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more

Say hey!

[Verse 1]
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

[Verse 2]
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

"The representative from California has the floor"
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause, just ‘cause
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint

Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
You drowned my fears in perfect love
You rescued me

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop

Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

Got a shit-eating grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City, since when did we begin to get dignity?
No diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your figgity-friends
I'm lookin' at your bum-stiggity-bum, hun
The miggity mack's biggity back, don't act wiggity-wack
You can get the figgity-finger: the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spiggaty-spin
Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Cîroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I'll call it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit, yeah, that little chick is hot
But if she got rabies I wouldn't give the bitch a shot
I'd poke her in the rear, but I bet if I lick her, she'll try to chase me
(Ha ha!) What are you: pit, rott, mixed?
Oh, you just got fixed, well shit, then let's lip-lock
If not, then trick, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit 'cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
'Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like the shit's sobbin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross
You'll dig this; if not, then kick rocks in flip flops!
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So crank the volume 'til it's bangin' and I'ma keep on sayin'
All the shit I should be hung for and probably killed for sayin'
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like Joplin 'til I drop, and still
If that don’t do the job of killin' Shady, then the karma will
They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done ate away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'
I ain't stoppin' til we explain it
Oh my god, for real, man, not again, I'm shakin'
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until it's—
Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'…
What's it called again? I'm blankin'
The thing above the balls between my legs
And I think that I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait, I think that I got it, okay
Bitch, I got you, (Robin Williams hangin')
Bitch, don't hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on, kemosabe, it's past time like your favorite hobby
'Cause of the way that I spit she remains on my dick
Then she grab me by the nuts
And try to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no-brainer
Or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbitt
Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it
Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it
And stuck it up between her armpit
And she begun to swing a karambit knife and paint the carpet
At least that's what her train of thought is
'Cause I came, saw, conquered it
Hit it, quit it, and made her plain b-bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches a complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you give this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I learned extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-ch
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car!
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick, so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie, so swallow my pride
You're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away, Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle or me?
(Squee!) I love it, love it, love it
'Fore I get lost we're gettin' off

And try not to get lost 'til we get to Las Vegas

Like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Lick her like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
And 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib wavin'
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store
With about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down and did an ALS challenge
Haaaan! I stole that adlib from French
Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sittin' on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothin'
Then that shouldn't mean nothin' to you like likes on the 'Gram
If she current, I keep her pussy purrin' like the pipes on a Lamb
Weed got her so chinky-eyed
Look like she been gettin' high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fuckin'
Sound like I'm shakin' up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas
I make you my ex miss if this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listenin' to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
(Bitch, get the fuck out of my face!)
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter
Startin' to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me, I said say, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the 9 like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and yo' friend
The only fear I have is of loathin'
And I won't even kick in 'til we get to Las Vegas

[Bridge: Eminem]
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow, no sorrow)

'Til we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'til tomorrow)

'Til we get to Las Vegas

Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas

[Verse 1]
Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

[Chorus 1]
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go

[Verse 2]
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me

Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me

Not the way that I do love you
Holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
Girl, I never loved one like you

There ain't nothing that I need
Hot and heavy pumpkin pie, chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you

Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, alleyways and pay phone calls

Laugh until we think we'll die, barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree, like it's only you and me
Geeze, you're something to see

Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate

And what's the worst you take from every heart you break
And like the blade you stain, well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say? Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight

Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again when both our cars collide

So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me

Will never change for us at all

They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines

Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair

I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Verse 2]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to sing
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

I'm a Brooklyn baby

I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

Was messin' with his frozen zone, reminding him of romance

That only when you're older, you will see too

I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck has gotta bleed through
It's gotta bleed through
You held the balance of the time
That only blindly I could read you

It's like you told me
Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end

Reminds me of childhood memories

She takes me away to that special place
An' if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

An' pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
I know, feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late) I know
(There's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
I know, feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)

[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Outro]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking that the only option)
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking that the only option)
So how will I know that it's right?

[Verse 1]
I see the way you move
It’s so fluid
With you by my side
Got nothing to hide
Now that you're hurting I see the
Tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love was like gold to me

But you hold me closer to the light
Wouldn't find the bullet inside
Unless you magnified

But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I put my faith inside of my hands
Because I will be just fine

[Chorus]
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You gotta close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Well, no nah
Well, no nah

[Freestyle]
Sitting tight with my black jeans on and I'm paralyzed
Make your way toward the sun
Got the palest soul you ever seen
Oh darling, you mightn't be the one

Sitting tight with my curly hair
Making your way with that sheepish stare
Said are you real do you feel are you there

[Verse]
Ashes to ashes
In the embers I blaze
I gotta rise amongst it all
And I think
About your face everyday

But you hold me closer to the light
You wouldn't find the bullet inside
Only if you magnified

[Chorus]
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes to see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me?
Well, no nah
Well, no nah

I'm gonna need someone to help me
I'm gonna need somebody's hand
I'm gonna need someone to hold me down
I'm gonna need someone to care
I'm gonna writhe and shake my body
I'll start pulling out my hair
I'm going to cover myself with the ashes of you
And nobody's gonna give a damn

Son of a bitch, give me a drink

[Intro: Lil Peep]
Yeah
Yeah, ayy
Ayy

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you)
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you

I wish I didn't have a heart to love you
(I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you

Part 2: Sometimes Life Gets Fucked Up

[Chorus]
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (We get fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)
That's why we get fucked up (Fucked up)
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs

That we used to do
I was used to you (I was used to you)
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fuckin' kind of abuse
If you love me too
You would give me you (Give me you)
Lock me in your room
Don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (Everything you said)
Stays inside my head (Stays inside my head)
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 2]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again

[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[alarm clock rings]

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah

We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"

[Chorus 1]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

[Chorus 2]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my ticker fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

[Bridge]
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that

Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along

Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

No one comes near

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence"

Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

(Ooh) I'll cut my hair
(Ooh) To make you stare
(Ooh) I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

[Verse 2]
Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead?
Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet

(Ooh) My eyes went dark
(Ooh) I don't know where
(Ooh) My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh

(Ooh) Time is
(Ooh) Slowly
(Ooh) Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place

Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
But not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out

But you're not coming back again

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Nick Cave]
Take a little walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat
With a red right hand

[Verse 2: Nick Cave]
He'll wrap you in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

[Verse 3: Nick Cave]
You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the Bowery and the slums
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper
In his red right hand

[Organ Solo 1]

[Verse 4: Nick Cave]
You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed
By his red right hand

[Verse 1]
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Verse 2]
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Interlude]
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow

We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
An' what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, mmm
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
An' we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, oh
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
An' we'll make money selling your hair

But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind

[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show

[Verse 1]
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm, and all I taught her was everything
Mm, I know she gave me all that she wore

[Chorus]
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

[Verse 2]
I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
Mm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

[Chorus]
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

[Post-Chorus]
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be, yeah
Mm, mhm, oooh

[Bridge]
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?
Ooh, ah yeah, ah, ooh

It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[Boy George]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Sting]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Bono & Sting]
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

[Pre-Chorus]
Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

[Chorus]
And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Intro]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 1]
Straight up ahead, you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing
About how I feel about you and all those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell
Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have, brightness gone
So dark without you, girl

[Chorus]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

[Verse 2]
Family calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate
But you tell me I'm so generous and my self-worth isn't hideous
This psychedelic canvas of the person I'm becoming
Went from horror movie on TV to happy-ending-princess me
Processing the information transferred from your mind to me
At light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy
Feeling like a free ol' me when I was six and no worries
Would stop me from reaching the stars
A million miles away from me
Sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
Like a plague hitting my body except if I fall, I'm just fallin' for you
Conscious beyond knowledge, alterations are acknowledged
And the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action
Lovely day today, perfect time to open up to you
But I know that you're having fun
Wouldn't wanna mess this up for you
But I'm happy that you're happy, at least I do that much for you
Always glad you're with me
This emotion will be gone before you know

[Outro]
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy, girl
Time changed, we're different
But my mind still says redundant things, can I not think?
Will you love this part of me?
My lover is a day I can't forget
Furthering my distance from you
Realistically, I can't leave now
But I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
Keep me from going crazy

Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

[Verse 2]
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep

Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love

Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs
And I had too many flash fires
That I just let them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You say, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?

[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need

[Verse 2]
'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinking a hole in the earth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you, what you doing?"
And I said, "That's the point"

You don't know how to let go

Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed

Just 'cause I want it

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

I'll always be pickin' you up when you're down
So just turn around

Now that I know that anything's possible
I found a way, I found a way
No one can break what's so unbreakable

You know you gotta live like you wanna live
When it's time
To be free
You know you gotta be what you wanna be

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess & P!nk & both]
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

[Chorus: Nate Ruess & both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again

I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing

You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Got guns hidden under our petticoats

No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it

Oh my hair smells like chocolate

Got get it, go get it, go!

All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody

Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hanggang kailan
Ako maghihintay na para bang wala nang papalit sayo?
Nasa'n ka man
Sigaw ng puso ko'y ikaw hanggang ngayon, whoa-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Kung sana lamang ay nakita mo
Ang lungkot sa'yong ngiti
Isang umagang 'di ka nagbalik
Gumising ka at nang makita mo
Ang tamis ng sandali
Ng kahapong 'di magbabalik

Hanggang sa dulo ng ating walang hanggan
Hanggang ang puso'y wala nang nararamdaman
Kahit matapos ang magpakailanpaman
Ako'y maghihintay sa ngalan ng pag-ibig

Hanggang ang puso'y wala nang maramdaman

Ako'y maghihintay sa ngalan ng pag-ibig mo

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus: Luke & All]

Say you want me, say you want me out of your life

But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

Says "Leave it alone"

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

Far from this opera forevermore

All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

But I can't touch what I see

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Verse 2]
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me

We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty

We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

Haven't said a word—haven't said a word to me this evening

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Ugh!)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Ugh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put the sights over
Getting 2Pac money, twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings, never stumble, retracing my steps

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

[Chorus]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

[Verse 2]
Here's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

[Chorus]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

[Bridge]
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

[Chorus]
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess]
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Interlude: Janelle Monáe]
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Bridge]
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 2]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

[Bridge]
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Chorus 3]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you

You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)

And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (Hahahaha)

[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

[Chorus 2]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge 1]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called "love"
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohhhh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

She knows it's too late as she's walking on by

Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

[Verse 1]
Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment, this order's tall

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

[Verse 2]
Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

[Chorus]
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Day day de mm hm

Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours

Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: David Bowie]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

[Bridge 1]
Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones

Neon gravestones try to call for my bones

[Bridge 2]
'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated

Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already

Don't waste your time on me you're already

God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun, he's begging, "Babe stay, stay, stay"

"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you?"

[Verse 2]
Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home she's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you"

Well now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you'd just take off your mask
You'd find out everything's gone wrong

Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on

You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool"

Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

[Bridge]
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)

If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!

Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light

I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end

So limitless and free
Desperately in need

The snake, he's long, seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us

Driver, where you taking us?

The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
"Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want to kill you"
"Mother? I want to..."

Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
"The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence."

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks

Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (La la la la)

Now let’s eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)

You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or, live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
Motivate your ass, call me Malcolm X
Yo operator, or innovator
Fuck you hater, you can't recreate her, no, nuh-uh
You'll never recreate her no, hell no

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am

I'm your man

[Intro]
Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone

Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power dons, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger’s cold, empty your purse

They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery, now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round the family, pockets full of shells

(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

[Bridge]
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they’d be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I’d deliver
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn’t take one more step
I can’t remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock ’n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you’re in love with him
`Cause I saw you dancin’ in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin’ buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 3]
Now for ten years we’ve been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin’ stone
But that’s not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 4]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`Cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 5]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick!
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil’s only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan’s spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 6]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I’d heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn’t play
And in the streets: the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised him everything I could give
If only he would make the music live
And he promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
Bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."
They were singing
Bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die"

And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

And she said use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway

There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no

Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway

[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade..."
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care!

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on!)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on!)

She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"

Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

It's coming on
My future is coming on

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward."
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are."
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son

You're gonna be the one that saves me

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

Begin, Reagan, Palestine, Terror on the airline
Ayatollah's in Iran, Russians in Afghanistan
Wheel of Fortune, Sally Ride, heavy metal suicide
Foreign debts, homeless Vets, AIDS, crack, Bernie Goetz
Hypodermics on the shores, China's under martial law
Rock and Roller cola wars, I can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
But when we are gone
It will still burn on, and on, and on, and on...
We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it
We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it
We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it
We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning

[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 1]
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is aching, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let’s turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Linin' 'em up like ass cracks

Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the Inc.

The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, "It's not now or never, wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never, just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever

I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something

Does it ever?

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!"

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster

You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing

I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster

You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 1]
I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don’t believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the “Roche”
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asks me once if I’d look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

[Pre Chorus]
"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks the door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Gotta give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

[Verse 2]
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We’re swimming around, it's all I do

'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette

But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger

For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Their shadows searchin' in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)

My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene

Only then I am clean

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain

Building my rain up in the cloud

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes

I want to lay down by the fire with you
Where souls are glowing, ever warmer too
Your love surrounds me like a lullaby
Singing softly, you are mine, oh mine

Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old

Maybe the night
Holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might
Want to settle down, just be near
Stay together here

When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me

Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say "sit down; it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

The shade
Always comes at the worst time

[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

[Bridge]
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

[Bridge - Organ Solo]

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'

Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

[Bridge]
And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently

Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar

My word is good
Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all

But they've got planes and trains and cars

That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school

We can do whatever we want to

Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

[Verse 1]
Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

[Chorus]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

[Refrain]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

[Verse 2]
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

[Chorus]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

[Bridge]
Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet

[Chorus]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot)

[Verse 1]
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty"
I bet a lot of me was lost,
"T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
"You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!"

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
And it's our hearts that make the beat

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Pre-Bridge]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there

Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Remember when you broke your foot

That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

Hold my breath and let it bury me

Save me from myself, don't let me drown

There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

Back to the howling, old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you, babe
That's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe
You never do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

[Verse 2]
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

[Pre-Chorus]
I wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do

Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You know that you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry

He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology

Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

It's like we fell to the top

Cut my teeth and made a killing

Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

When you gonna say my name?

Take the makeup
Off your eyes
I've got to see you
Hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up
Comes the silence
I'm talking to you
You say you're over it
But I know
I thought I knew you
You thought you knew me
But now that you do
It's not so easy now
That I know

[Chorus]
You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know that we know
Never know what we know

[Verse 2]
And all your makeup
Just take it all off
I've got to find you
Before the line is lost
I know I hurt you
I won't deny it
When I reach for you
You say, "I'm over it."
But I know

[Chorus 2]
You can cry, I won’t go
You can scream, I won’t go

Would have run at the word go

Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don’t know what I know
It’s so little that we know

[Verse 3]
But the cup it overflows
Little boys with their porno
But this is their world
Where can we go?
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Little boys with their porno

Makes me feel like something's wrong
It's the only world we know

Yeah, something's wrong
Little boys with their porno
And boys they learn
Some selfish shit
Until the girl
Won't put up with it
On and on and on we go
I just have to know
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
You say love is real
Like a disease
Come on tell me please
I'm not over it

Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency

And you miss them like you miss no other

She rolled up in the Beamer, couldn't have looked cleaner
Skin like coffee, colour with lil' creamer
Sin City since I been thinkin' all of these thoughts in my head, she'd probably shoot me dead
God-damn, she got the hoops on
Hair bunned up in two just like a nunchuck
Would I give a fuck? I need to mature myself up
But I fell in love right when she said
"I wanna count the freckles on your face"
"Rearrange 'em, put 'em in the same place"
I'm obsessed, I'm obsessed, I'm obsessed

Gone take it back a couple steps
Hands on your hips all night
Hold my hand til it feels right
Beat that left right left
Gone take it back couple steps
Hands on your hips all night
Hold my hand till it feels right

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I picture you suckin' it on the sofa
Eyes rolled back, somethin' like a coma
Pick you up, ride around to my favorite albums
Hit me up, cut me off, who be next?
Break a text, freeze frame
Grab your hand, freeze frame
Tell me how you feel (tell me how you feel)
Never feel real (never feel real)

Ow-oh, that you only wanted me tonight?

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Take the chapstick, put it on your lips

Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall

Why would you lie about something dumb like that?

Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 3]
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 4]
Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Chorus]
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

[Verse]
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity

[Chorus]
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

[Outro]
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times

[Verse 1]
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause you're so far past me now
Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more a mind can do
You're so famous now

[Pre-Chorus]
Got your Bible, got your gun
And you like to party and have fun
And I like my candy and your women
I'm finally happy now that you're gone

[Chorus]
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy (Yeah, yeah)
You get a little bit of bourbon in ya
You get a little bit suburban and go crazy (Yeah, yeah)
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You dance in circles around me
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me

[Verse 2]
I shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I found another, anyhow
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I could see you leaving now

[Pre-Chorus]
I got your Bible and your gun
And you love to party and have fun
And I love your women and all of your heroin
And I'm so happy now that you're gone

[Chorus]
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy (Yeah, yeah)
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
You go a little bit suburban and go crazy (Yeah, yeah)
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You dance in circles around me
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me

Got your Bible and your gun
You like your women and you like fun
I like my candy and your heroin

[Verse 1]
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

[Verse 2]
There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

[Bridge]
I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day...

[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Ad lib/Instrumental break]
C'mon baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)

[Verse 3]
Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Take me away!


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Verse 2]
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Bridge]
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

"Well I only brought 3, what you lookin' at me for?"
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
"Well you're the best man, so what's the plan?
Why don't you talk to Matty about it?"
I said, "I only brought 3 like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about."

Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
Who's he? Giving it the lips?
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but 6 foot 3
So I reckon you could knock him out

"Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind...
I never really got on with your bird the first time I met her out
Dressed in nowt, telling everybody you were shagging about"
Well, who's this? Going for the kiss
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's 5 past 3, I can hardly see and I'm on the verge of passing out

[MAFALA, spoken]
In this part of Africa, we all have a saying. Whenever something bad happens, we just throw our hands to the sky and say "Hasa Diga Eebowai!"

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Hasa Diga Eebowai?

[MAFALA. spoken]
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times.  There's war, poverty, famine... but having a saying makes it all seem better!

(sung)
There isn't enough food to eat
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
People are starving in the street!

[UGANDANS, MAFALA]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Well, that's pretty neat!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Does it mean no worries for the rest of our days?

[MAFALA, spoken]
Kind of!

(sung)
We've had no rain in several days

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
And 80% of us have AIDS

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
Many young girls here get circumcised
Their clits get cut right off

[ALL]
Way-oh!

[WOMEN]
And so we say up to the sky

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA, spoken]
Now you try! Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky, and list off all the bad things in your life!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Somebody took our luggage away!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE]
The plane was crowded
And the bus was late!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
When the world is getting you down
There's nobody else to blame!

[UGANDANS]
Way-oh!

[MAFALA]
Raise your middle finger to the sky
And curse His rotten name!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Wait, what?!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Am I saying it right?

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Excuse me sir, but what exactly does that phrase mean?

[MAFALA, spoken]
Well, lets see... "Eebowai" means "God".  And "Hasa Diga" means... "Fuck You".  So I guess in English it would be "Fuck you, God!"

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
What?!

[MAFALA]
When God fucks you in the butt

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
Fuck God right back in His cunt!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Excuse me, Sir, but you should really not be saying that.  Things aren't always as bad as they seem!

[MAFALA, spoken]
Oh really? Well take this fucking asshole, Mtumbo, here.  He got caught last week trying to rape a baby!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
What?! Why?!

[MAFALA,spoken]
Some people in his tribe believe having sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS.  There aren't many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
But that's horrible!

[MAFALA, spoken]
I know!

[UGANDANS]
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

[MAFALA]
Here's the butcher, he has AIDS
Here's the teacher, she has AIDS
Here's the doctor, he has AIDS
Here's my daughter, she has A
Wonderful disposition
She's all I have left in the world
And if either of you lays a hand on her
I will give you my AIDS!

[UGANDANS]
If you don't like what we say
Try living here a couple days
Watch all your friends and family die
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(Fuck you!)
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Fuck you God in the ass, mouth
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth
And cunt-a
Fuck you in the eye!

Hasa
Diga Eebowai!
Hasa
Fuck you in the other eye!

Fuck you God!

Fuck you God!
In the cunt!

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water

Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish bumped into me
I swear he was trying to talk to me, to me, to me

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball

Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

And see the place where you used to live

My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

[Verse 2]
Now turn away, cause I'm awful just to see
Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go, it just ain't living
And I just hope you know

You need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
We need to cry
And if we do, I know that would be alright

[Verse 1]
The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

[Chorus 1]
Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; I wonder, did you love me at all?

[Verse 2]
The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain riding the wall
Daniel’s message: blood of the moon on us all

[Chorus 2]
Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?

[Bridge]
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

[Verse 3]
The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

[Chorus 1]
Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch

[Outro]
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow

[Verse 1]
Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 2]
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 3]
Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 4]
The king called up his jet fighters
He said "You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way"
As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Outro]
(Shareef don't like it)
Thinks it’s not kosher
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Fundamentally can’t take it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
You know he really hates it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Really, really hates it

Be the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun

Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

[Verse 2]
What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true

She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

Keep it light and keep it moving

As my world comes crashing down

Deaf, dumb, and blind

This my excavation and to–
–day is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed
I keep throwing it down two
Hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell

[Chorus]
On your back with the racks as the stacks of your load
In the back with the racks and the stacks are your load
In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load

[Verse 2]
I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground
There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks of your load
In the back with the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're unstacking your load

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone, can't change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain – distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone, take care, my love
Miss you, love

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Oh, someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you

The sorrowful gust of wind that blew right between you and me
Where did it find the loneliness it carried on the breeze?
Looking up at the sky after shedding a stream of tears
I could see for miles of blue, it's never been so clear

[Verse 2]
Speeches that my father gave me would always make me despair
Somehow, I feel a warmth and comfort today
Your ever kind heart, the way you smile, and even how you find your dreams
I knew nothing, so honestly, I've always copied you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, just a little more
Only just a little more
Let's stay here a little longer now
Now, just a little more
Only just a little more
Let's stick together just a little bit longer

[Chorus 1]
Oh yes, we are time fliers
Scaling the walls of time, climber
Tired of playing hide and seek with time and always coming just short
Crying even when you're happy
Smiling even when you're feeling lonely
It's because a part of you
Has made it here before the rest has

[Verse 3]
I used to wish upon the stars, the toys that I once adored
Forgotten now, are rolling 'round the corners of the floor
Finally, my dreams have counted up to a hundred today
Someday, I'll trade them all for just the very one

[Verse 4]
Girl that I have seen in school, that never have told "hello"
After class today, I waved and said, “See you tomorrow”
It's not really that bad trying something new every once in a while
Especially if I can do it with you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, just a little more
Only just a little more
Let's stay here a little longer now
Now, just a little more
Only just a little more
Let's stick together just a little bit longer

Oh yes, we are time fliers, so, and I
I knew who you were way before...
Way before I even knew my own name
There's no clue, but I'm sure, I swear

[Bridge]
Even if you're not around in this wide world
Of course it surely would have some kind of meaning
But if when you're not around in this crazy world
Would be like the month of August without summer break
And if you're not around in this great world
Would be like Santa Claus without any glee
If you're not around in this wide world

[Break]
Oh yes, we are time fliers
Scaling the walls of time, climber
Tired of playing hide and seek with time and always coming just short
No, never mind that
No, never mind what I said now
'Cause I'm on my way to you

[Chorus 3]
Oh, we are time fliers
Dashing up the steps of time now
No more playing hide and seek with you and time
And always coming just short

[Outro]
You're quite a showy crier
Want to stop your tears, see your eyes drier
But when I went to wipe your tears dry
You refused but I saw them pouring down your face, I knew why
Crying even when I'm happy
Smiling even when I'm feeling lonely
It's because the heart of mine
Has made it here before my body

Scream out, "What will save us?"

Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seems to end
Are we just ladders in this world of snakes?
'Cause if life is one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing, sing me asleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
D'you want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we are all doomed

So leave a light on, I'm comin' home

And now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now, there's no way back

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth savin'
So come rain on my parade

[Chorus]
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed
And now, there's no way back

[Verse 1]
Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?

Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss
A hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet
Sweetie, you had me

Girl I was it, look past the sweat
A better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

[Chorus]
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

[Post-Chorus]
So, I guess we're back to us
Oh cameraman, swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off?
(Let's pick up and go)

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Verse 2]
Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

And only I can save me now

Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me!

For what's been missing right here

So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year, but

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

[Verse 2]
You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought
You down to your knees that

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah

[Middle 8]
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week

Or magazine, you know what I mean
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Moving but she just can't move

Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

[Verse 2]
She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's got two-tone everything, way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move

On the floor and in my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"

Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We’ll have Satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the Chateau lobby

[Chorus 1]
I’ve never done this
Baby, be gentle
It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

[Chorus 2]
And I’ve never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
Here take my last name

[Bridge]
First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script:
"Stay as long as you want," and I haven’t left your bed since

[Chorus 3]
I haven’t hated
All the same things as somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for, uh, what are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true

This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends’ bodies
When the floodwater comes, it ain’t gonna be clear, it’s gonna look like mud
But I will help you swim, I will help you swim, I’m gonna help you swim

This is for the snakes and the people they bite
For the friends I’ve made, for the sleepless nights
For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more

It’s no big surprise you turned out this way
When they closed their eyes and prayed you would change
And they cut your hair, and sent you away
You stopped by my house the night you escaped
With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay
You said “Hey man, I love you, but no fucking way”

I’m sure that we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies

This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in
Naked and dumb on a drunken night
And it should've felt good, but I could hear the Jaws theme song
On repeat in the back of my mind
Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face
There are lessons to be learned
Consequences for all the stupid things I say
And it is no big surprise you turned out this way
The spark in your eyes, the look on your face, I will not be brave

I’m sure we could find something for you to do on stage
Maybe shake a tambourine, or when I sing, you sing harmonies

I wanna contribute to the chaos
I don’t wanna watch and then complain
‘Cause I am through finding blame
That is a decision that I have made

She hopes I’m cursed forever
To sleep on a twin size mattress
In somebody’s attic or basement my whole life
Never graduating up in size to add another
And my nightmares will have nightmares every night
Oh, every night, every night

And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

"I don't love you like I did yesterday?"

Sometimes, I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you ought to stay

Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa

And it's not my fault
That I fucked everybody here

I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er

[Verse 2]
Oh, brother, we go deeper than the ink
Beneath the skin of our tattoos
Though we don't share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you, that's the truth

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're living different lives
Heaven only knows
If we'll make it back with all our fingers and our toes
Five years, twenty years, come back
It will always be the same, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

[Post-Chorus]
I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er

[Bridge]
And if we hit on troubled water
I'll be the one to keep you warm and safe
And we'll be carrying each other
Until we say goodbye on our dying day
Because I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er

Oh, Ms Believer, my pretty sleeper
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
Inside your head than the winter of dead

[Pre-Chorus]
I will tell you, I love you
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
To travel through snow, together we go
Together we go

[Chorus]
We get colder as we grow older
We will walk so much slower

[Verse 2]
Oh, Ms Believer, my pretty weeper
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
Please, take my hand, we're in foreign land
As we travel through snow, together we go
Together we go

We get colder as we grow older
We will walk so much slower

In the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

[Saxophone Solo]

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on with me, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Zion doesn't love You
And Babylon don't love You
But You love everything
Oh, You saint
America don't love You
So I could never love You
In spite of everything

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark of this place
There's the glow of Your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go

Oh, the motherland don't love You
The fatherland don't love You
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless, they don't love You
The zealous hearts don't love You
And that's not gonna change

All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel

Outside the tents
On the festival grounds
As the air began to cool
And the sun went down
My soul swooned
As I faintly heard the sound
Of You spinning "Israelites"
Into "19th Nervous Breakdown"

Something has to change
Undeniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear
Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way

She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to
Assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a
Taste of what you paid for

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

Whoa, Mona Lisa, I'd pay to see you frown

Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning

Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!

The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue

Beat me black and blue

But you know some people never do
You know, when people change
They gain a peace, but they lose one too

Cuz I've been waiting on you
I've been hanging on you

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?

To be without a home?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth

Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops

And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place

And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain

Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

Da-de-da-la-de-da
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
Da-de-da-la-de-da

[Verse 2: Gary Cherone]
Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Verse 2]
Boy, now your life is back-to-front
But you'll see that's not for long
'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes

[Verse 1]
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmmmm

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

[Hook]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

[Verse 3]
Asking only workman's wages, I come lookin' for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, lalalalalalala

[Verse 4]
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

[Hook]
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me
Leadin' me
Goin' home

[Verse 6]
In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving", but the fighter still remains

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie

Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well, it’ll be a miracle
Do you believe you're missing out?
That everything good is happening somewhere else
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through

[Chorus 1]
And I will die all alone
And when I arrive I won’t know anyone

[Verse 2]
Well, Jesus Christ, I’m alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?
Because this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend
Well, Jesus Christ, I’m not scared to die
But I’m a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot?
Do I float through the ceiling?

[Chorus 2]
Do I divide and pull apart?
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
And this ship went down in sight of land
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?

[Bridge]
I know you're coming in the night like a thief
But I’ve had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
I know you think that I’m someone you can trust
But I’m scared I’ll get scared and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up
So do you think that we could work out a sign
So I’ll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try
I know you're coming for the people like me
But we all got wood and nails
And we turn out hate in factories
We all got wood and nails
And we turn out hate in factories
We all got wood and nails
And we sleep inside of this machine

Encased in case I need it
In my stomach, for my heart
Chain mail

Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly

Realisation grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cool side of the pillow
I’m there for you, be there for me
I’ll hum the song the soldiers sing
As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands
People!
One nation, under God, indivisible
It feels so good to be back!
With liberty and justice for all
Mosh with me now!

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, moving past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband Man – yeah, he just snaps back

[Hook]
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp
We gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors, come on!

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause, no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain – yeah, the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't
We're stronger now more than ever
They tell us "No!" we say "Yeah!" They tell us "Stop!" we say "Go!"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just—

Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin', how could we allow
Somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists? Now
This is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six
-teen million people, all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizin' a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why—‘cause I told you to fight!

And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!

Tides that I tried to swim against

Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna

Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing—

Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

Wake up to a cloudy day
Dark rolls in, and it starts to rain
Staring out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushing candy, crushing pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Texting exes, get my fill
Sweating bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singing the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: "Really, what's the use?"
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life

[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (medicate)

[Verse 2]
Can't wait to feel better than I ever will
Attack that shit like a kid on Benadryl
Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, I can go for miles
They say family's all you need
Someone to trust who can help you breathe
Inhale that drug, but you start to choke
You fall on the outs of an inside joke

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
Cause I've seen enough of it, heard enough of it, felt enough of it
Had enough of it!

I am so frickin' bored

Superman is a hero
But only when his mind is clear, though
He needs that fix like the rest of us
So he's got no fear when he saves that bus

All those flavors of the rainbow
Too bad that shit don't work though

Your parents are high right now

And no one's ever coming down!

You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired

[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattle of Bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
You!
Your sex is on fire, ahh
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
And you!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's to transpire

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Verse 2]
You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love

May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May you take no effort in your being generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more nothing less
May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

Well here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it
Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You don’t need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

Oh! I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all

May you be as fascinating as a slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions though immeasurable wealth
May you get a gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes shining like diamonds
May you really own it each moment to the next

And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

If you believe it then anything can happen
Go, go, go raise your glasses
Go, go, go you can have it all
I toast you

[Verse 1]
Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon

[Verse 2]
Now it's your turn to be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home
You have learned way too soon
That your dad is now the Pantaloon

[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Bridge]
He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon

[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Verse 3]
You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
'Cause your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights

[Chorus]
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
So lose your mind

You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move
And now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you
Just sayin’

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

Sinking halfway to the bottom
There's a loud distorted screaming in my soul
Everything is dark and empty
And I don't know how to fix it
So I curl up in a ball
And cry in the comfort of my home

I don't know why
I feel like shit
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine

I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings

[Verse 2]
I think there's something wrong with me
'Cause all I see is death
Every time I go outside
I look like I've been doing meth
And I sleep for nineteen hours
On a Thursday afternoon
Every now and then I cough up blood
And I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't know why
I feel like shit
I will not see a therapist

Ladies and gentlemen, if you wanna fucking kill yourself put your fucking hands up (yeah!)
Raise your blades in the air everybody (yeah!)

[Verse 1: Father]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm
When you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

[Verse 2: Son]
How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go

[Verse 3: Father & (Son)]
It's not time to make a change (Away, away, away)
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault (I know)
There's so much you have to go through (I have to make this decision)
Find a girl, settle down (Alone)
If you want you can marry
Look at me (No)
I am old, but I'm happy

[Verse 4: Son & (Father)]
All the times that I've cried (Stay, stay, stay)
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard
But it's harder to ignore it (Why must you go)
If they were right, I'd agree (And make this decision)
But it's them they know, not me (Alone)
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go

We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream

She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

Caught in a never-ending game
Seems like the world's still trying to tame me
If that's the way, I will obey
Beautifully struggle every day
Soon we have a little kiss
While seeing both of our hourglasses
Let's make a plan to meet somewhere that is
The most far from "goodbye"

[Verse 2]
Finally, the time has come
Everything up 'til yesterday was a prologue
Just skimming through the days of old
It's my turn to bear the load
With my experience and my skill
And all the courage I had let start to mildew
At an unprecedented speed, I will
Dive right into you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And when I dozed off into a lukewarm can of soda, I
Dreamed of a world so far from here that's not on the map
Searching outside of the classroom window
Or in a summer morning, that's brought from the commuting train
Ooh

[Refrain 1]
Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach

Even the second, hour hands of the clock
They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
How I hope to have forever to spend
This life, no—all future lives
Right here in this world with you

[Verse 3]
Let's put away them far ahead
"How do you do"s and all the "Nice to meet you"s
And breathe over a thousand-year cycle in a single day

[Verse 4]
How I hated lifeless world
That's made up entirely of dictionary words that
I saw through my kaleidoscope
On a monotonous August morn'
When you appeared in front of me
You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
If it's the textbook of this world
Of how to make your smile on your face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've been looking for "incredible"s, the meaning of "unbelievable"
I even hope for tragedies if it goes with the thrill
But when you were standing in front of my door
With every piece in your hand that I could ask for

[Refrain 2]
Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
No matter how far they extend their hands
Let's breathe, and dream, we'll play together in this place
What do you say?

[Bridge]
Even the way that you loved
I swear I could smell the scent of yours
And in the way that you walked
I could hear that bright laughter of yours
Since one day you will disappear
I'll keep every part of you
Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes
It's not a right that I'm due
My duty that is must have been kept

[Refrain 1]
Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach

Even the second, hour hands of the clock
They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
How I hope to have forever to spend
This life, no—all future lives

And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah

'Cause you're the last of a dying breed

But only for you, but only for you

I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah

Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me

Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you
And what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

There was a wayward lad
Stepped out one morning
The ground to be his bed
The sky his awning

[Verse 2: Joe Newman]
Neon, neon, neon
A blue neon lamp in a midnight country field
Cows surround so you lean on, lean on
So much your hugs become hold ons

[Chorus: Joe Newman + Gus Unger-Hamilton]
Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language

[Verse 3: Joe Newman]
Well, that smell of sex
Good like burning wood
The wayward lad lay claim
To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came:

[Bridge: Ellie Rowsell]
"Girls from the pool say, "Hi" (Hi)
The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time?
Love is just a button we pressed
Last night by the camp fire"

Oh, these three worn words
Oh, that we whisper

Lying beside you
Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2]
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

[Pre-Chorus]
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me

I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end

And I said what's up?
What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long
I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie
To keep this thing from going down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

[Verse 2]
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Verse 3]
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing
Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour

[Chorus 1]
I will run (all around it)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
I'mma make it half the night
Hall light wishes

To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave, your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming

I will run (all around it)

Have to crawl (carry off and up your seize)
Still can't— (Along—)
I will run (carry up love along unfettered time)

Now Mona (Now Mona)
Haven't I locked up my failure (sailing off and ore your odd, your honour)
From the core to the sky
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seize)
From the door till we die
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Was it all I could find (atonements defined)
Keep waking up high

I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

[Verse 2]
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, "Mom, I love you," like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

[Chorus]
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

[Bridge]
I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

[Chorus]
Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
(The man that I was meant to be)
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
(The man that I was meant to be)
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

Red as strawberries in the summertime

Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and from, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 1]
It's going off cos they're not gonna let him in
2 and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

A broken half a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, 'It's my car I'm sleeping in'

Dès le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

[Pre-Chorus]
Matching set of marching clocks, the slumbering apparitions
That they've come to wake up

[Verse 2]
Here I am composing a burlesque out of where they rest their
Necks sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

[Bridge]
How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!

And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless

[Verse 2]
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep

She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn

And given half the chance, would I take any of it back

It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone

It's always darkest before the dawn

'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me

But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album "Cherry Bomb" because "Greatest Hits" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; "Who's in charge of this Golf shit?"
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick."
It's young T

[Bridge]
I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life

[Outro]
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)

[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think... think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye...

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello

You've seen my face like a heart attack, don't you mind, don't you mind

I'm sorry, but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die
Exaggerate and you and I
Oh, I think I did something terrible to your body, don't you mind

I put your mother through hell, don't you mind

A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

[Verse 2]
A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

[Chorus]
Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Verse 3]
In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces

If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth

Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind

Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life (didn't do it for you)

We will come to pass, will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah
The wicked get no rest
You can have my heart, any place, any time

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't have to take your heart

Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

[Chorus]
Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La la la la...

[Verse 2]
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass, I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

La la la la...

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end

To even your honey dew

Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby

I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (how cool is that)
How cool is that? So I went to your room
And read your diary
"Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table..."
And then my heart stopped:
"Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again." (Ow!)

I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
"I'm falling for you"

I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team

I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love (This world is only gonna break your heart) with you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I... (This world is only gonna break your heart)
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal

Confusing, confusing what is real

Controlling) Confusing what is real

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

[Chorus 1]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the 80s
But gravity always wins

[Chorus 2]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears...

[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

[Chorus 3]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

[Verse 1]
I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read:

[Hook]
"If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape"

[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad:

[Hook]
"Yes, I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape"

[Verse 3]
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Aw, it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew"

[Hook]
That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape

[Hook]
If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

[Hook]
Yes I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

Spirit of my silence, I can hear you
But I’m afraid to be near you
And I don’t know where to begin
And I don’t know where to begin

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the desert, there’s a forest
And an acre before us
But I don’t know where to begin
But I don’t know where to begin
Again, I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired, old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table (On the table), is it real or a fable? (Is it real or a fable?)
Well, I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper (Be my keeper)
Silhouette of the cedar (Silhouette of the cedar)
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well, I got nothing to prove
Well, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 5]
I forgive you, mother, I can hear you (I can hear you)
And I long to be near you (And I long to be near you)
But every road leads to an end
Yes, every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me in the willows
Five red hens – you’ll never see us again
You’ll never see us again

And what have you done with the one I love?
When I look into your eyes, I see no surprise

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
We make believe
I've never seen your face, you neither me
Don't catch my eye
Don't register a smile
You were more than just a friend, oh, but the feeling
It never came to an ending, I can't bear you seeing

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

When I see you again
I'll know not to expect
Stay one step away
We won't have to wait
When I see you again
And I'm greeted as a friend
It is understood
That we did all we could

The night is ours
Spring in the wood of skies
We head to the heath with our tent, where the berries grow
Take me, dear friend to the mirth of yesterdays
Where our creek runs free and the birch will blow

Light in the mountains
Scent from our dearest fountains
The wind is counting your hair in the light aglow

The dew comes forth
Our valley is swept with peace
Our dreams come true, who sleep in the wood of skies
On the berry hearth, the last touch of sunlight dies
And the calm is deep where the quiet waters flow

Light in the mountains
Scent from our dearest fountains
The wind is counting your hair in the light aglow

My head is hauntin' me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel somethin', 'cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side
Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one-man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you, 'cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in
I'll be your gravity, you be my oxygen
So dig two graves, 'cause when you die
I swear I'll be leaving by your side

So you can drag me through hell

Go ask Alice

And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call...
He called Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

Into your blues, into your blues!
I see your hair is burning
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars, the topless bars
Never saw a woman so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone
Motel money murder-madness

Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
So, shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Heart is taking over

We must be mistaken

In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones

Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water

Water, oh, oh

[Verse]
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me

But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain

I'm just being dramatic
In fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind

As it blows me back and forth
Bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow

But it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed
As a crazy, suicidal head-case

But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming, "Father!"
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water

Oh, oh, water

[Chorus]
Hello, I haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind

You were here when I wrote this
But the masters and mixes
Will take too long to finish to show you
I'm sorry I did not visit
Did not know how to take it
When your eyes did not know me
Like I know you

Well, this is the very, very last time
I'm ever going to

Said I know that I'll be happier

I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times

I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a great coat"
And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends"

Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"

"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man you're putting me up on a shelf
"Well I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"
And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene,"
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

[Verse 1]
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no

Help me out
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah

Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changing me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be

Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you got to help me out, yeah

Over and in, last call for sin
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done

Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will Nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

Someday, someday

Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't often prowl before I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)

When you call my name

I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there

You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing

Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
I never doubt that
That's 'cause you

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue and
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

Dead in the middle
Of the C-O-double-M O-N
Little did I know then
That the Mandela Boys soon become Mandela Men

Tall woman
Pull the pylons down
And wrap them around the necks
Of all the feckless men that queue to be the next

Steepled fingers
Ring la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-leaders

In your hoof lies the heartland

Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

[Verse 2]
Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you

[Verse 1]
I've had enough
There's a voice in my head says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, I'll be alright

[Verse 2]
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, you'll be just fine, 'cause…

[Chorus]
Every now and again we get that feelin'
And the great big void inside us opens up
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles

We're all fucked in the head, alone and depressed
But if we sing along a little fuckin' louder
To a happy song, maybe we'll forget, 'cause…

Every now and again we get that feelin'
And the great big void inside us opens up
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles
Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreamin'
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
An' I really wish that you could help but my head is like a carousel
An' I'm goin' 'round in circles, I'm goin' 'round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go!)

[Part I: Jesus of Suburbia]

[Verse 1]
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "None of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in Hell, as far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with

[Chorus]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In the land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Verse 2]
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room on my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

[Chorus]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Part II: City of the Damned]

[Verse 1]
At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is" but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care

[Verse 2]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Part III: I Don't Care]

[Chorus]
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care!

[Verse]
Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

[Bridge]
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe (Said it's, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe
And I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care

[Part IV: Dearly Beloved]

[Verse 1]
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

[Verse 2]
Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home]

[Verse 1]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

[Chorus]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 2]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
The lights of masochists

[Chorus]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home

You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Verse 1: Brendon Urie]
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway

Something that will keep you warm
And show we can be more than just this
So baby if you are not ready for my kiss

And you can tell your friends we'll be together till the end

When you go to sleep at night, When you wake up in the morning

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road

(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
(Do, do, do-do-do-do-do)
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

[Verse 2]
You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I want to be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woollen jumper
(Do, do, do-do-do-do-do)
Be your Minpin
And Borrower of handsome trivia

Oh...Devour me
Oh...Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!

[Instrumental break with female vocalization]

[Verse 3]
All handclaps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room!)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
(Ooohh)
I'm gonna kiss you
Like the sun browns you

Oh...Devour me
Oh...Devour me

Oh...If you really think that you can stomach me

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again

Wake me up when September ends

Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

And I wonder if you ever think of me

You feel a little inside
The trouble and strife
And now you spend your evenings
Searching for another life
And yeah I think, mate

You were the one I tried to draw

You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand

Let's find a place where happiness begins

[Verse 1]
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 2]
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Verse 1]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
"Get that together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Verse 3]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 4: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Verse 5]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say "Wasabi"

This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, "Bitch, get back in the door"
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it

Wide awake, I don't know the time

I'm over the loneliness and I can't close my eyes
Without you by my side

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free

Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died

Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

Ich will ein Feuerstarter sein
Whitney wird mich immer lieben
Und Michael lässt mich nich' allein

[Strophe 2]
Ich war willkommen im Dschungel
Und fremd im eigenen Land
Mein persönlicher Jesus
Und im Gehirn total krank
Und ich frage mich, wann
Werd' ich, werd' ich berühmt sein
So wie Rio, mein König für die Ewigkeit
Ich war am Ende der Straße angelangt
War ein Verlierer, Baby, doch dann
Hielt ich ein Cover in der Hand
Darauf ein Mönch, der in Flammen stand
Kurt Cobain sagte mir, ich soll kommen wie ich bin

[Refrain]
Und ich singe diese Lieder
Tanz' mit Tränen in den Augen
Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held
Und EMF kann es nich' glauben
Und ich steh' im lila Regen
Ich will ein Feuerstarter sein
Whitney wird mich immer lieben
Und Michael lässt mich nich' allein

[Strophe 3]
Ich war einer von fünf Jungs
"One Minute" aus, dann war's vorbei
Ich sang nur noch für mich, für ‘ne unendlich lange Zeit
Dann traf ich auf sie
Und sie erinnerte mich
Wir waren Welten entfernt
Und doch vom selben Stern

[Bridge]
Ich ging wie ein Ägypter
Hab' mit Tauben geweint
War ein Voodoo-Kind
Wie ein rollender Stein
Ich ließ die Sonne nie untergehen
In meiner wundervollen Welt

[Refrain]
Und jetzt singe ich meine Lieder
Tanz' mit Tränen in den Augen
Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held
Und EMF kann es nich' glauben
Und ich steh' im lila Regen
Ich will ein Feuerstarter sein
Whitney wird mich immer lieben
Und Michael lässt uns nich' allein

[Refrain]
Denn wir singen diese Lieder
Tanzen mit Tränen in den Augen
Bowie war für'n Tag ein Held
Und EMF kann es nich' glauben
Und wir stehen im lila Regen
Wir wollen Feuerstarter sein
Whitney wird uns immer lieben
Und Michael lässt uns nich' allein

[Verse 1]
In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

[Chorus]
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

[Verse 2]
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

[Chorus]
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come

Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Come on Eileen!

[Verse 1]
Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You've grown (You’re grown up!)
So grown (So grown up!)
Now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts (I confess)
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on Eileen

(Come on Eileen!)

[Verse 2]
These people round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (No never)
But not us (Not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And you'll hum this tune forever, oh

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)

Can barely stand on my feet

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

You were perverted too

[Verse 1]
Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

[Pre-Chorus - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Verse 2]
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

[Pre-Chorus - Variation - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

[Verse 3]
Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache

And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"

You're too mean, I don't like you

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)

Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)

You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me

I saw this angel
I really saw an angel

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling across the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh, ah-ah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My-my-my-my only angel

[Verse 1]
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Verse 2]
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Bridge]
When we laugh into the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs

Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got 70 days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I said "I got no idea"
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

This me "Yeah, baby, and the rest"

I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"

There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining, everybody's in the play
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day, hey
Running down the Avenue

In the city, on the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey

Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we’ll never die

[Verse 2]
Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

Just because they're younger days

Swear that we'll never die

Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

And a black tar palm keeps weeping your name

And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow

It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

Two steps far from you

Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah

Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine

Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

[Verse 2]
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living

Crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone

Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself

Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from

Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)

Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

We were destined
Young hearts

The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

Indochina: Capa jumps Jeep
Two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record, meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance
(Ooh) Very yellow-white flash!
A violent wrench grips mass
Rips light, tears limbs like rags
Burst so high, finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
Him five yards from his leg
From you, Taro
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

[Verse 2]
3:10 pm: Capa pends death
Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
3.1415, alive no longer my amour
Fated for home, May of '54
Doors open like arms, my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
Reunited with his leg and with you, Taro
Taro
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes

Hey Taro!

And a temper lost like crying tears in rain
No love is lost or no sweet wisdom gained
So save your tears then save yourself the shame

Cyclone
You’re on your own

[Verse 2]
As we left the house and took a step outside
I could taste in the air a familiar sense of pride
And the wind, it blows, as you held your head up high
Then I saw the clouds draw storms into your eyes

Cyclone
You're on your own

He's my man but said, "Don't break him bones"
Out in the fire, won't leave it alone
It was bent and I was unable to pull him inside
So burn down them bridges, dig up them bones
What's that you got? 'Cause I'll have one of those
Darcy, I could never hate ya if I tried

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face

I've had that dream a thousand times

[Verse 1: Hamilton Leithauser]
I left my room on the West Side
I walked from noon until the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your old house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
My eyes were red, the streets were bright
Those ancient years were black and white

[Pre-Chorus: Hamilton Leithauser, Together]
The 10th of November, the year's almost over
If I had your number, I'd call you tomorrow
If my eyes were open, I'd be kicking the doors in
But all that I have is this old dream I’ve always had

I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure

You come any time you want, yeah

Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

And said, “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me "Doody"?

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Bridge]
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

[Verse 2]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Guitar Solo - 3:20-4:13]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking, people
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
We will get low

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose

You know it's alright, it's okay

Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

[Verse 2]
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feeling within me, everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again

I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive

I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I could still feel alive

The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

Chill out, whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated

And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see

Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns

Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

[Chorus]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
How's it go again?

[Verse 2]
"Goodbye, goodbye,"
I said to my bestest buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else

[Chorus]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
How's it go again?
How's it go again?

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo]
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be

Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young

Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

And I want to feel something again
I just want to feel something again
How's it go again?

Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again (my favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again (my favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel something again? (my favorite color is you)
Can I finally feel something again?
How's it go again?

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again

So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk

[Chorus: bearface & No Rome]
Losing my way, ohh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah

Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry

A thousand words pour out of my mouth
Distance over depth is proven unannounced
Is it real? Cause I don't feel alright

I got this notion
In the deepest ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Tell your mother she don't understand
Tell your mother she's not listening
Why don't you tie my heart with chains made of string
I rolled the dice
You sealed the deal
That don't matter
The pain is real
I won't follow you
Into the dark

I got this notion
In the deepest ocean

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, "Well... how did I get here?"

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone

Here a twister comes, here comes the twister
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)

I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three, maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy

I’m light as a feather
I’m bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief

No, I’m not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe

When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy

I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don’t back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I’m a fool in the fetter (fool in the fetter)
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me

Don’t back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter (brother had a daughter)
The beauty that she brings, illumination (illumination)

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

[Verse 3]
We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

[Outro]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
"Letter" come to me—"mail." "Sweater", "heat," "some degree."  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

Since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie..
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...

[Verse 1]
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya'

Are you shopping anywhere?
Change the color of your hair
And are you busy?
Did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time
Are you still busy?

Well my body's been a mess

The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

If I’m born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace

See the sun go down
It’s going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light

And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

But in my dreams, we're still screaming

Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand

But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

So they can watch all the things you do

'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

You can let your girl get in front, I play the back seat
Relaxing your mind, that’s my intuition
Once our chemistry combine, love is revolution
I cherish every moment, I’m a better man

"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter"

[Bridge]
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa

[Chorus]
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you, only sweeter"
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
(For the memories) "See, he tastes like you, only sweeter"

You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

[Verse 1]
Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look! He's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die!"
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said, "I've got a lot to learn"

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Verse 2]
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

[Breakdown]
She likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant
She's American (She's American)
She says I've got to fix my teeth

[Verse 1]
Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat

There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Verse 2]
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib

And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Bridge]
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamp light, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

[Chorus]
When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

I told you, but I know you never listen

It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out

I don't know, I just remember being so much brighter.... I guess
Yeah, it's a weird thing, like, I don't know hehe uhm... I definitely feel like I'm at the beginning of all this and I want it to be really beautiful uhm, and I guess that's the best way to look at it. Just take it


[Verse 1]
So tell me this is who you are
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, you could be loved
But I don't want the lights to find me when I'm dark and lost
But never on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it
And then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said you'll never be alone again
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
But you could be loved
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun

[Verse 3]
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
Oh, that's all I want, yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No... yes, it gets easier
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'

[Outro]
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
What's under the words you know - that's all I want
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
Something more than superficial is all I want
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll - that's all I want
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well
At least that's living
The more you know who you are and what you want...
That's all I want
...the less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer but I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses, you know, take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out - I'm not worried about you

[Extended]
If all we had is time then we’ll be alright
It’s not much but it’s better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that’s all I want
What’s under the words you know that’s all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll that’s all I want

It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

"Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die"

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

"Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles"

The hospital asked, "Should the body be cast?"
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk

Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?

[Post Chorus]
Feed my will to feel my moment
Drawing way outside the lines

[Verse 1]
Black
Then
White are
All I see
In my infancy
Red and yellow then came to be
Reaching out to me
Lets me see

[Verse 2]
There is
So
Much
More and
Beckons me
To look through to these
Infinite possibilities

[Pre-Chorus]
As below so above and beyond I imagine
Drawn outside the lines of reason
Push the envelope
Watch it bend

[Chorus 2]
Over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind

[Post-Chorus]
Feed my will to feel this moment
Urging me to cross the line
Reaching out to embrace the random
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come

[Bridge]
I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to
Feel the rhythm
To feel connected
Enough to step aside and
Weep like a widow
To feel inspired
To fathom the power
To witness the beauty
To bathe in the fountain
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral
Of our divinity and
Still be a human

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin
I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or
Whatever will bewilder me
Whatever will bewilder me
And following our will and wind
We may just go where no one's been
We'll ride the spiral to the end
And may just go where no one's been
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going

Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself"
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

Oh, the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone so won't you call it up for me?
Oh the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong but give me one

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough

They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now

And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt

I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

New blood joins this Earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see

Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me

They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen

Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

It's the last time you will

Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

I am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
But the only girl that could talk to him just couldn't swim
Tell me what's worse than this
And it echoes in the halls
They danced along the walls
The memories of your ghost
You are the one that I used to love
And I'm still in love, but I've never loved you the most

I've seen better days
So unafraid in my youth
I can't breathe, much less believe

You gave me everything you had
Every little thing you had
A pure love unrehearsed
I've seen your best and worst
And at your worst, you're still the best
But at my best, I am the worst
It's a curse
Your eyes are lined in pain
Black tears don't hide in rain
And I tied you to the tracks
When I turned around, I heard the sound
I hit the ground, I know there's no turning back

My muscles will contract, your bones will crack
It's just a fact 'cause I am here to win this fight

Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest

Wide awake before I found you

We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleedin'
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'

[Verse 2]
Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you
And I shoulda done you just the same
But I came to love you, am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'

[Verse 1]
I've been in a rut, ducked off from the sun
Bit my gun with my black gold gums
I'm no fun, I'm no fun
Blood run marathons down my chest (Down my chest!)
I'm a mess, ain't nobody gonna clean up
Bulletproof your limousine
I been in the, market for a brand new soul
Daddy hit a brand new low
Better yet, another agoraphobic episode
Here we go again, here we go again, here we go
Cut me up to little pieces like you're Ed Poe
Let me rest in pieces underneath the floorboards
Planet on fire, no fucks given
I'ma let us all die, let us all die, really I

[Refrain]
I haven't been good to myself
And you haven't been good to me
I haven't been good to myself
And lately, you haven't been good to me

[Verse 2]
Lately, I decided I'ma stay alive
I just wanna live and see society die
Looking around and all I see is at the end of the line
I see a dystopia, dystopia!
Evil all over and no one is (Safe)
Nihilist, I am the finest, though I don't align with it
(We're all to blame)
Keep on denying it!
You think that I need you
I'll show you I'm fine

[Segue]
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you!?

You think that I need you (Need you!)
I'll show you I'm fine (I'm fine!)

I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

[Verse 1]
So I been doin' a good job
Of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

[Chorus]
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

[Verse 2]
And if I go out tonight
And dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
Ooh ooh
I shoulda known when things were going good
That's when I'd get knocked down

[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

[Verse 2]
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Ah

[Verse 1]
Gone a little far, gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know? How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline, caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign, I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Bridge]
There I go


Start of song 


[Verse 1]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

[Chorus]
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 6: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 7: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

[Verse 8: Paul McCartney]
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste, all you feel
And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust, all you save
And all that you give and all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal
And all you create and all you destroy
And all that you do and all that you say
And all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)
And all that you slight and everyone you fight
And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

Matter of fact it's all dark

Must've been forces, that took me on them wild courses
Who knows how many poses that I've been in
But them the main closest, hark! It gives meaning mine
I cannot really post this, ah feel the signs

[Chorus]
I worried 'bout rain and I worried bout lightning
But I watched them off to the light of the morning
Marking the slope, slung low in the highlands
(Where the days have no numbers)
If it's harmed me, it's harmed me, it'll harm me, I let it in

[Verse 2]
Oh, the old modus: out to be leading live
Said, comes the old ponens, demit to strive
A word about Gnosis: it ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts, or weigh to find

[Chorus]
I hurry 'bout shame and I worry 'bout a worn path
And I wander off, just to come back home
Turning to waltz, hold high in the lowlands
(Cause the days have no numbers)
It harms me, it harms me, it harms me like a lamb

[Verse 3]
So I can depose this, partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit, how high I've been
What a river don't know is to climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses or stay behind

[Chorus]
I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off, how long I'd last
Sore-ring to cope, whole band on the canyon
(When the days have no numbers)
Well it harms me, it harms me, it harms me, I'll let it in

We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know and we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light

We going to stand up for our right

Thanks for all you've shown us
But this is how we feel
Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea
Just like grandma made, when we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then, once but never again
We've all left the den, let me tell you about it

A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay

My name is Wepeel
Got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do, now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat, and you know what else?
Guess what I received in the mail today
Words of deep concern from my little brother

The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah

Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no
Till it pulled us to that time and place
And I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking; it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain

[Chorus]
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
I never wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way

So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this

Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

[Verse 1]
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother

Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?

Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry

[Verse 1]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over...

[Verse 2]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over...
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:

[Verse 3]
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms..."

[Chorus 2]
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

Sometimes my love may be put on hold
Sometimes my heart may seem awful cold
These times come and these times go
As long as I live, all you need to know is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had, and all that's next
'Long as my heart's beatin' in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

Often a heart tends to change its mind
A new day decides on a new design
A new day gets set on another way
As long as I live, all I've got to say is

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on

[Chorus]
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

[Verse 2]
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should've seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins, and now

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things

That I can touch, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed

I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Torn

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

She said, "At night, in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes"

She said, "Darlin', you know
How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs"
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's intact
And in an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
And lately, I can't take it

Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun

Lazy, and lying on your belly
With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe, I wish I could remould you
To vertical and golden
But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

[Intro (Sampled)]
"Almost forty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb, and an attack upon the cities of man. And even now we are only beginning to see the aftermath of a massive display of destruction and power, that has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilized society. Despite the rubble, there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel at the awesome nature of this technological terminus that has bewildered the very core of the human psyche."

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, at night I let it get to me
And sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes that is not enough

[Pre-Chorus]
No, sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up, or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

[Verse 2]
And thinking back upon those days
Way, way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well you know just what they say
"Just like father then like son"
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head so

Stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna

If you are the dealer
I'm out of the game
If you are the healer
It means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified
Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the help that never came
You want it darker

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle-class and tame

You want it darker

Hello, there's a place I've been going
There's a place I've been going
Now I'm clean, it would seem
Let's go somewhere I'll be seen
As sad as it seems
I seen Greg and he was like
"I seen your friends at the birthday party
They were kinda fucked up before it even started
They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show
They didn't know about all the weird stuff
So they just left it" (So they just left it)
I was wasted (I was wasted)
And cold, minding my business

[Verse 2]
Then I seen the girls and they were all like
"Do you wanna come and get fucked up?"
Listen, I got myself a missus, so there can't be any kissing
"No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid
It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it"

[Verse 3]
"This ain't going well", I thought that I was stuck in Hell
In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel
About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well
You pulled away when I went in for the kiss
No, it wasn't a diss
You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss
After four years, don't you think I'm over all this?
"That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room
He's gotta share for a bit"
You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby
To get things that they don't have

[Verse 4]
Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya?
You know that I could sue ya if we're married
And you fuck up again
Impress myself with stealth and bad health
And my wealth and progressive causes
Drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha
Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it
Look, the fucking state of it
I came pretty late to it
We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture

All your friends in one place
Oh, we're a scene, whatever that means
I depend on my friends to stay clean

The nights I've stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reviews life's mystery

Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing

And it flows right through your blood

And remember how to love

There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in

To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
We end where we begin

Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

[Verse 2]
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, win the war for America

Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Buffalo Soldier troddin' through the land, wo-ho-ooh!
Said he want to ran and then you want a hand
Troddin' through the land, yea-hea, yea-ea

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier in the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean

Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Behold a new Christ
Behold the same old horde
Gather at the altering
New beginning, new word
And the word was death
And the word was without light
The new beatitude:
"Good luck, you're on your own"

[Verse 2]
Blessed are the fornicates
May we bend down to be their whores
Blessed are the rich
May we labor, deliver them more
Blessed are the envious
Bless the slothful, the wrathful, the vain
Blessed are the gluttonous
May they feast us to famine and war

What of the pious, the pure of heart, the peaceful?
What of the meek, the mourning, and the merciful?
All doomed

And if I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all, but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat

[Verse 2]
But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years
And let go
Give these ghosts a new home
And let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start

[Bridge]
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean

[Verse 3]
Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah, I'm still learning

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty sea
A flash of light
It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I’m on your side
You wide-eyed girls
You get it right

For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?
What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost?
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes

Oh... You don't like that? Or do you just not like me!
Sorry I don't treat you like a goddess
Is that what you want me to do?
Sorry I don't treat you like you're perfect
Like all your little loyal subjects do
Sorry I'm not made of sugar
Am I not sweet enough for you?
Is that why you always avoid me?
That must be such an inconvenience to you
Well... I'm just your problem
I'm just your problem
It's like I'm not even a person, am I?
I'm just your problem
Well, I shouldn't have to justify what I do
I shouldn't have to prove anything to you
I'm sorry that I exist, I forget what landed me on your blacklist
But I shouldn't have to be the one that makes up with you
So... why do I want to?
Why do I want to...
To... bury you in the ground
And drink the blood from your...ahhh

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away

Cause I don't wanna fall, fall a—way (la, da, da, da, da)
I don't wanna fall, fall a—way  (la, da, da, da, da)
I don't, I don't wanna fall away  (la, da, da, da, da)

I disguise and I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away
As I stand in line, and I die as I wait as I wait on my crime
And I'll try to delay what you make of my life
But I don't want your way, I want mine
I'm dying and I'm trying
But believe me, I'm fine, but I'm lying
I'm so very far from fine

And I, I can feel the pull begin
I feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin, it will start

Every time I feel selfish ambition is taking my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission
It's taking a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I am dying or living
Cause I will save face for name's sake, abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became a new destiny to the grave

And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin, it will start

I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

Maybe it's all down to the thought of her
Maybe it's all down to the loss we learned
Knew for a long time, for all it's worth
I wanted to run to you
What if I'm caught up and it's me you're calling?
What if I'm lost now 'cause of demons comin'
When she kissed me, I felt a new freedom or something
Well, move on
I found a moment to be brave, so I let her know
And she said, "How could I love you back?
You who dropped your dreams in the gutter"
And in my winter, she'll be burning slow
Feels like December knows me well

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved ya
Does that mean nothing to you now?
I loved ya
Get me back on homely ground
She said, "Oh, I know that love is all about the wind
How it can hold me up and kill me in the end"
Still I loved it
Does that mean nothing to you now?

[Verse 2]
Days when we all watched 'til we lost the birds
Threw a rose in 'til it caught the turn
Knew it felt right, we were bound to burn
I wanted to run to you
Maybe I've lost count of the rooms you're tall in
Maybe I've lost count of the nighttime all-ins
So the trees and her were first to know
It'll all be good, just hold me well

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved ya
Does that mean nothing to you now?
I loved ya
Get me back on homely ground
She said, "Oh, I know that love is all about the wind
How it can hold me up and kill me in the end"
Still I loved it
Does that mean nothing to you now?

[Bridge]
Wasn't easy to go, I know
You shouldn't have no seat in the front row
I know, I know
Wasn't easy to go, I know
And the sun came out, day late though
I know, I know
Wasn't easy to go, I know
He pulled up, flat tyres, ten spokes
I know, I know
Wasn't easy to go, I know
He came all that way just to say, "Hello"
I know, I know

'Cause I loved ya
Does that mean nothing to you now?
'Cause I loved ya

All alone smoking his last cigarette

But my hands been broken once, too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop

[Verse 2]
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up

She says she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out, a joke of a romantic
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse" vs
"No one should ever feel like..."

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

[Verse 2]
You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love

You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead

Engkau bagai air yang jernih
Di dalam bekas yang berdebu
Zahirnya kotoran itu terlihat
Kesucian terlindung jua

Cinta bukan hanya di mata
Cinta hadir di dalam jiwa
Biarlah salah di mata mereka
Biar perbezaan terlihat antara kita

Kuharapkan kau kan terima
Walau dipandang hina
Namun hakikat cinta kita
Kita yang rasa

Suatu hari nanti
Pastikan bercahaya
Pintu akan terbuka
Kita langkah bersama

Di situ kita lihat
Bersinarlah hakikat
Debu jadi permata
Hina jadi mulia

Bukan khayalan yang aku berikan
Tapi keyakinan yang nyata
Kerana cinta lautan berapi
Pasti akan kurenang jua

[Verse 1]
Remember when Hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give
All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But Heaven was in my head

[Chorus]
They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

[Verse 2]
The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost, I can live
Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through
Yeah, death is an open door

[Bridge]
Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday
Yeah

They say "the good die young"
No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough

Can you quack
Can you quack like a duck when you suck
Can you buck like a horse when we fuck
Can you take every inch up your butt
Can you shit on my chest for good luck
Can you quack
Can you quack like a duck when you suck
Can you fart on my balls when we fuck
Can you stick your whole tongue up my butt
Can you shit on my chest for good luck
Can you quack
Can you quack like a duck when you suck

Give it a suck
Give it a fuck
But you ain't cute enough to where I want to knock you up
And if you swallow it whole can you take it up the butt
Now I might keep you around long enough to bust a nut
Well I want to knock you down
Cause I want to knock you up
All I really want to do is fuck you in the butt
Then you turn around and then you suck it up
While your girlfriend's behind me with her tongue right up my butt

[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

[Chorus: All]
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

[Verse 2: Liam]
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down

Holding you in my arms

[Verse 1]
The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 2]
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 3]
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

The sycophantic teens
What a precious basket case
(Yeah, yeah)

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself to sleep
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
You get everything you want
And money always talks
To the idiot savants

To smile while you suffocate and die

And I gave it all away, just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally

But I can't bear to stay in
I just know, I know, I know, I know

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel (Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me (Will you give in to me?)
Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes
Oh no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness

Open up your hate and let it flow into me

You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel (Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me (Will you give in to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Don't do it, you're hurting me!
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch!
Fuck you! I don't need this shit!

Haha, charade you are
Wooh!
You well-heeled big wheel
Haha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Sayin', "Keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun

And do you feel abused?

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you

I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die

Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again (Whoo!)

Somebody said I'm a fuckin' slum
Don’t know where I belong
Maybe you’re fucking dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe you’re fucking scum
Don’t you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time (stop)

Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead

[Bridge]
Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time

Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?

Think I'm just happy

My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down

And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover

Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up

As we glide over whatever
We know to be over forever
I really hope the shame is less
For what we feel in times of stress

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I guess that's just depression
No sense in fighting it now
You had me caught in your headlights
You were running me down

[Verse 2]
We speak in tongues and start to teethe
Lift your voice and scrape your knees
Kids in love will plant a seed
Resurrect and start to breathe

I thought I was a creator
I'm here just hanging around
Got my messiah impression
I think I got it nailed down

I want to tell you we're alright
Want to erase all your doubt
I've got this thorn dug in deeply
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out

[Verse 3]
I'm strumming with a heavy wrist
Were you one of the cured kids?
My shins burn for the replica youth
I hope that we can eject soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I don't want to surrender
Or lose your face in the crowd
I finally found all my courage
It was buried under the house

[Chorus]
Not just a manic depressive
Toting around my own cloud
I've got a positive message
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out
Sometimes I can't get it out

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you

[Verse 2]
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Sk8er boi rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Chorus 2]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”

Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

[Introduction]
Tu te demandes si tu es une bête féroce ou bien un saint
Mais tu es l’un, et l’autre. Et tellement de choses encore
Tu es infiniment nombreux
Celui qui méprise, celui qui blesse, celui qui aime, celui qui cherche. Et tous les autres ensembles
Trompe-toi, sois imprudent, tout n’est pas fragile
N’attends rien que de toi, parce que tu es sacré. Parce que tu es en vie
Parce que le plus important n’est pas ce que tu es, mais ce que tu as choisi d’être

[Couplet 1]
Oh qu’est-ce que tu fais ? Arrête !
Qu’est-ce qu’il te prend de faire des trucs pareil ?
Pourquoi tu te fais du mal comme ça ?
Qu’est ce qui ne va pas ? Parle-moi, tu sais que tu peux tout me dire
Mais nan mais c’est des conneries tout ça tu le sais
Regarde-moi dans les yeux. Regarde-moi. On s’en branle, c’est pas important
Moi je te trouve magnifique. Depuis la première fois que je t’ai vu
D’ailleurs, je ne m’en suis toujours pas remis
Et puis comment je ferais sans toi moi ?
Et puis comment l’univers il ferait sans toi ?
Ca ne pourra jamais fonctionner. C’est impossible
Alors faut pas pleurer ! Faut pas pleurer. Parce que ça va aller je te le promets, ça va aller
Parce qu’on est de ceux qui guérissent, de ceux qui résistent, de ceux qui croient aux miracles
Pas de ceux qui disent que lorsque les tables bougent, c’est que quelqu’un les pousse du pied
Mais un jour tout ça on n’y pensera même plus
On aura tout oublié, comme si ça n’avait pas existé

[Pont]
En attendant passe tes bras autour de mon cou si tu veux
Pendant que je te répète ces phrases qui nous donnaient de l’élan
Tu te souviens ?.. Tu te souviens ?

[Couplet 2]
Tu nous entends le Blizzard ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends, va te faire enculer
Tu pensais que tu allais nous avoir hein ?
Tu croyais qu’on avait rien vu ?
Surprise connard !
Tu nous entends la Honte ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends fais gaffe quand tu rentres chez toi toute seule le soir
On pourrait avoir envie de te refaire la mâchoire avec des objets en métal
Ou de te laver la tête avec du plomb, qu’est-ce que t’en dis ?
Tu nous entends la Tristesse ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends, c’est que toi aussi, tu vas bientôt faire ton sac
Prendre la première à gauche, deuxième à droite, puis encore à gauche et aller niquer ta race
Félicitations ! Bravo !
Tu nous entends la Mort ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends sache que tu nous fais pas peur, tu peux tirer tout ce que tu veux
On avance quand même, tu pourras pas nous arrêter
Et on laissera personne derrière, on laissera personne se faire aligner
Tout ça c’est fini !

[Couplet 3]
Tu nous entends la Dignité ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends sache qu’on a un genou à Terre et qu’on est désolés
On est désolés de tout ce qu’on a pu te faire, mais on va changer !
On va devenir des gens biens, tu verras !
Et un jour tu seras fière de nous
Tu nous entends l’Amour ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends, il faut que tu reviennes parce qu’on est prêts maintenant, ça y est
On a déconné c’est vrai mais depuis on a compris
Et là on a les paumes ouvertes avec notre cœur dedans
Il faut que tu le prennes et que tu l’emmènes
Tu nous entends l’Univers ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends, attends-nous ! On arrive
On voudrait : tout comprendre, tout savoir, tout voir, tout vivre
On cherche la porte du nouveau monde pour pouvoir s’y fondre en grand
Tu nous entends toi qui attends ? Tu nous entends ?
Si tu nous entends souviens toi que t’es pas tout seul. Jamais
On est tellement nombreux à être un peu bancals un peu bizarres
Et dans nos têtes il y a un blizzard
Comme les mystiques losers au grand cœur
Il faut qu’on sonne l’alarme, qu’on se retrouve, qu’on se rejoigne
Qu’on s’embrasse, qu’on soit des milliards de mains sur des milliards d’épaules
Qu’on se répète encore une fois que l’ennui est un crime
Que la vie est un casse du siècle, un putain de piment rouge
Nique sa mère le Blizzard
Nique sa mère le Blizzard
Tout ça c’est fini

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical locomotive
That's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky
Locomotive, my motives are insane
My flow's not great, okay
I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating

Hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping

Oh, I just love the kind of woman who can walk over a man
And I mean like a god damn marching band
She says, like, literally, music is the air she breathes
And the malaprops make me want to fucking scream
I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well, it's literally not that

[Verse 2]
Of the few main things I hate about her
One's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

[Bridge]
Oh my God, I swear this never happens
Lately, I can't stop the wheels from spinnin'
I feel so unconvincin'
When I fumble with your buttons

[Verse 3]
She blames her excess on my influence
But gladly hoovers all my drugs
I found her naked with her best friend in the tub
We sang "Silent Night" in three parts which was fun
Till she said that she sounds "just like" Sarah Vaughan
I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on
Why don't you move to the Delta?
I obliged later on when you begged me to choke ya

Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long Island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

[Chorus 1]
So can we pretend, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

[Verse 2]
Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I’m painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord, hear my prayer
I’ve wasted my throes on your head

[Chorus 2]
So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

[Verse 3]
I’m holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved, my John, so I’ll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

[Chorus 3]
So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus, I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Did you get what you deserve?

No one ever had much nice to say

Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead? Oh, dead

You never fell in love

Found a complication in your heart

When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can fuck yourself

Wooden floors, walls and window sills

And I built a home
For you

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

[Verse 1]
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 2]
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Bridge]
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

[Verse 3]
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 1]
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

[Verse 2]
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

[Bridge]
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

Mr. Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I’ve ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I’m so alone
Don’t have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I’ve ever seen
Give him the word that I’m not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I’m so alone
Don’t have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Bung, bung, bung, bung

Mr. Sandman (Yes?)
Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr Sandman, someone to hold (Someone to hold)
Would be so peachy before we’re too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr Sandman, bring us, please, please, please
Mr Sandman, bring us a dream

I'm not that nice
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

Yeah!

Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

You die
And words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

Although you could have done more

How could this be done

Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
Is such an ugly word for something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking

I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son

[Chorus]
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
You can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around

Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

[Verse 4]
Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
Heh, and that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care

Oh, and I guess I just don't know

Step forward and meet a new sunrise

With unconditional loyalty
Ego hardly can be piqued
'Cause I'm selfless

No promises I ever give
Don't rely on me and I won't deceive

I grew in different normality
With unblamable morality
Hooks and nets are there for me
But I'm skittish

All their life against the stream
Searching for a hook to catch on
And see their sun beam

There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
And school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Like maybe

[Verse: Bowling for Soup, Phineas, Candace]
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)

[Outro: Bowling for Soup, Phineas, Candace]
As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do
Before school starts this fall (Come on, Perry!)
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!

How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 2]
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong

Of nothing in particular

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

[Verse 2]
There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

[Verse 3]
When you say "it's gonna happen now"
When exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

[Chorus]
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

[Verse 1]
Oh, the last time I saw Paul
I was horrible and almost let him in
But I stopped and caught the wall
And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin

Yeah, we hopped inside my car
And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
And he turned the headlights off
Then he pulled the bottle out
And then he showed me what was love

[Chorus 1]
I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 2]
In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

[Chorus 1]
I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 3]
Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain

[Chorus 2]
I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left


Start of song 


I wish you'd walk in again
Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh, sleepless Knights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died

I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes

So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun

I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nails red
And if I live past 72, I hope I'm half as cool as you

I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright

Made in my room, this simple tune
Will always keep me close to you
The crowds will sing their voices ring
And it's like you never left

But I'm bereft you see
I think you can tell
I haven't been doing too well


Start of song 


[Intro]
In the backseat of my heart
My love tells me I'm a mess
I couldn't get the car to start
I left my keys somewhere in the mess

[Verse 1]
It comes and goes in plateaus
One month later, I'm a fucking pro
My parents would be proud
Or fall asleep on the floor
Forget what happened in the morning
There are notes in your handwriting
But you can't make it out

[Chorus 1]
We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
This is not a good thing
I don't mean to rationalize
Or try and explain it away
It's not okay
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

[Verse 2]
It's too late to articulate it
That empty feeling
You share the same fate as the people you hate
You build yourself up against others' feelings
And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill
I have become such a negative person
It was all just an act
It was all so easily stripped away

[Pre-Chorus]
But if we learn how to live like this
Maybe we can learn how to start again
Like a child who's never done wrong
Who hasn't taken that first step

[Chorus 2]
We are not a proud race
It's not a race at all
We're just trying
I'm only trying to get home
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers
Put it out of your mind
And perish the thought
There's no comfort in responsibility
Drunk drivers, drunk drivers

[Chorus 3]
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales

[Verse 3]
Here's that voice in your head
Giving you shit again
But you know he loves you
And he doesn't mean to cause you pain
Please listen to him
It's not too late
Turn off the engine
Get out of the car
And start to walk

[Bridge]
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers
Drunk drivers

[Chorus 3]
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
It doesn't have to be like this
Killer whales, killer whales

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

[Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

[Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

[Pre-Hook]
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling, now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

[Pre-Hook 2]
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Outro]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now? (and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover?

(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?

[Verse 1]
When I'm stable long enough
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral print
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on earth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Verse 2]
Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer
Oh, can't she be a little straight?

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah
On a weekend wanna wish it all away
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason, oughtta leave her calm, I know
I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know I don't want to stay

Make me cry

I don't know, there's something else
I wanna drum it all away

Out on the porch
Yeah but they don't wave

Couldn't really love you any more
You've become my ceiling
I don't think I love you anymore
That gold mine changed you
You don't have to hold me anymore
Our cave's collapsing
I don't wanna be me anymore
My old man told me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
"You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down."
Forty miles out of East Illinois
From my old man's heart attack

[Chorus 1]
I believed you were crazy
You believed you loved me

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna bark here anymore
Black hills, the colly
Wasn't really dangerous for us
We'd just catch you coughing
What the hell are we gonna do?
A black mile to the surface
I don't wanna be here anymore
It all tastes like poison

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
Forty hours out of Homestake
And I'm trying to translate you again

[Chorus 2]
I believed you were crazy
You believed you loved me
You and me, we're a daydrink
So lose your faith in me

Can't open your eyes for a while
You just beat that moment down
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe

You and me, we're a daydrink
So lose your faith in me

Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees

Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you when I found out
You had cancer of the bone

[Verse 2]
Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

[Chorus 1]
In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulderblade
I could see what you were reading

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

[Verse 3]
Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens

[Verse 4]
I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

[Chorus 2]
In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared

All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

[Verse 5]
Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother

[Verse 6]
On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

[Chorus 3]
In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window

In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing

All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window

All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes

He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie
But this time, he decides that it's alright
It's alright

No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize before
He goes to lock the door

He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns

Get up, Johnny Boy, get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, 'cause the world has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy, because we all need you now
We all need you now

[Verse 2]
Someone said, "Where you goin'?"
And someone said to you, "Goodbye."
They deflect the disrespect
When they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the times

We all know you're qualified
To fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified
But they lie when they blame it on the times
Oh, we blame it on the times

Oh, he has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns

Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I was switchin' up the lanes
Steppin' out the frame I'm in
I was pulling on the reins
Sick of all the same happenin'
I swear I was looking for disaster
Mixed with a bottle of gin
And just because I come home after
Doesn't mean you'll take me in

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
You see my world is spinning like there's nothing below
You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get it right, need to see some light come in

Can't I just turn back the clock?

[Verse 2: Logic]
Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
I feel like everything I've done before is different now
But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
Every day I do it, I been goin' through it
But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you
I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
I'ma get it right now, don't know how
But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
I'm all in, it's from the heart again
Open up your mind and maybe we could start again

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up in the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Please, won't you push me for the last time
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

[Chorus 1: Vic Fuentes]
You told me think about it, well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

[Verse 2: Vic Fuentes]
The thing I think I love
Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up
Pubescent drama queens
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late

[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
(Scream) Until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr I'll be one
Because enough's enough we're done

[Chorus 2: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
You told me, think about it, well, I did (Well, I did)
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
And if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
(Alright here we go)

[Bridge: Vic Fuentes]
Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, now this is war
Fuck with this new beat
Oh

[Breakdown: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift so close your eyes
And rest in peace

[Chorus 3: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
You told me, think about it, well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
Imagine living like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screaming take us now
We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground
Shit

Baby, I'm dying for another taste

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder

Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love (Ohh)
Baby, your electric love (Ahh)
Electric love

Drown me (Drown me), you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me, hold me deep beneath your waves

[Verse 1]
And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh mum check the car it can’t have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It’s likely in a Sainsbury’s
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
Your brain was last seen going for a run
"And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura?
Cause she adores you
But I think you’re shit"
"I’ve gotta look for my brain for a bit!”
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
“Well what do you expect when you’ve got no mind!”
I searched all day it drove me insane
“Where would I be if I was my brain?”

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
The nice nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
"Oops I did it again" started playing
Forget my brain, remember my name

[Verse 1]
The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
For me to drive away with
I began to understand why God died

[Verse 2]
The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

[Chorus]
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, "I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way"

Then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, "I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way"

[Interlude]
I began to understand why God died

[Verse 3]
The air begins to feel a little thin
As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now, you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw it held your heart
For me to walk away with
I began to understand why God died

Come on!
Ugh!

[Zach de la Rocha]
Come on
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never edit
The needle I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close to the
Rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements cease when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (what!) the judges (what!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah!
Yeah, back in this!

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head?

I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies

Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now

Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

And his proposition for that “virgin”
Yes, the one the lawyer met with, on “strictly business”
As he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind

Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Outro: Luke]
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

[Verse 1]
Ancient holy wars
Dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real
Original sin, genetic fate
Revolutions, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
The commentary to comment on

[Chorus 1]
Oh, and no one ever really knows you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This black hole and me?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden boughs and mercury
Bohemian nightmare
Dust-bowl chic
This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness

[Chorus 2]
Oh, and no one ever knows the real you
And life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with
This atom bomb and me?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Colosseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name
Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

[Outro]
Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?
Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
What I fail to see is what that's gotta do
With you and me

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

An old man turned 98
He won the lottery, and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

[Verse 2]
Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought, "Well, isn't this nice?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

[Bridge]
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

[Verse 3]
It's a traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
And yeah, I really do think

[Chorus]
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought—it figures!

And yeah, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out

If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me

[Verse 2]
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wait for me, I can't come

[Chorus]
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

[Bridge]
You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

[Chorus]
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl

Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall

Afterlife, oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

[Chorus]
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?
Till we work it out, till we work it out
Till we work it out, till we work it out

[Verse 2]
Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

Can we work it out?
We scream and shout till we work it out
Can we just work it out?

Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Can we last another night?
After all the bad advice
Had nothing at all to do with life
I've gotta know

Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name, your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner
We stay in place
Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of something better

[Chorus]
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

[Verse 2]
My brain has given up, white flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought, it might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain throws up onto the page
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, cause we're terrified
Of what's around the corner

Cause we don't wanna lose our lives

Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

[Bridge]
Quickly moving towards the storm, moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned

Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus

This holy experience
Choosing to be here in

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and
Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing

Embrace this moment, remember

[Verse 1]
There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

[Chorus]
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Verse 2]
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen he was no wheeler-dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

[Chorus]
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Spoken]
But when his drinking and lusting
And his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something
About this outrageous man
Became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came

[Chorus]
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra, ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

Oh, those Russians....

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

[Chorus 1]
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

[Chorus 2]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69

Oh!

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

[Chorus]
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was; up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

[Instrumental Break]

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah

Of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps
To be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing

In the end it’s coming
There’s nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain
Just how I'm gonna feel

Anticipation growing

It's getting closer

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending, never ending
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

[Verse 2]
In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're
Temporary, temporary
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

[Bridge]
I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirroring your stare
I'm what's left
I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, tell me
Why are you still so afraid, hmm?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do and only so many hours in a day-ay

[Chorus]
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Verse 2]
Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight

Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right

[Chorus 2]
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

[Chorus 4]
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?

Ha ha ha ha, this is about you

[Verse 1: Cody Carson]
Beware, beware, be skeptical
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning
Baa baa, black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals?
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibis are turning tricks

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

[Verse 2: William Beckett]
Aware, aware, you stalk your prey
With criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem
Fee-fi-fo-fum, you better run and hide
I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack be lethal, Jack be slick
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

[Bridge: Cody Carson]
Maybe you'll change
Abandon all your wicked ways
Make amends and start anew again
Maybe you'll see
All the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over again

[Spoken: Cody Carson]
Who am I kidding?
Now, let's not get overzealous here
You've always been a huge piece of shit
If I could kill you, I would
But it's frowned upon in all fifty states
Having said that, burn in hell!

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
So tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what."

"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done."

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been."
And he played:

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

[Chorus]
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 3]
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

[Bridge]
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 4]
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"

Did I hold you too tight?

If your mind should sway
It's not a secret you should keep

We used to be closer than this

I've been ashamed
All my life
I've been playing games

Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath

I’m through with standing in line to clubs I’ll never get in
It’s like the bottom of the ninth and I’m never gonna win
This life hasn’t turned out quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(Ah, so what you need?)
I’ll need a, a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny 'cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar, oh
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I’ll have the quesadilla, ha-ha)
I’m gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
And we’ll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today’s who’s who
They’ll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody’s got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar, oh
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar

I’m gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don’t get 'em wrong

Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

Everybody wants a flame, but they don’t want to get burnt
And today is our turn

Nights like this lead to

You light the spark in my bonfire heart

This world is getting colder. Strangers passing by
No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the eye

Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine
Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt
Well today is our turn

[People like us, we don’t need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Bonfire hearts, oohhh bonfire sparks
Hmmmm

People like us, we don’t need that much
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

[Chorus- James Blunt]
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart

Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

The bottom of the sea
Your eyes

Why should I stay here?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way Out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way Out)
Is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes

Hit the bottom and escape

Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat

Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do do do do do do

You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain

I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to hell
Oh well, now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die

Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now, they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies

Well mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once
You should've been, I could have been a better son

But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along

We're damned, after all
Through fortune and flame, we fall
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on
When our brothers in arms are gone
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die
And return from the ashes you call...

[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 3]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

[Verse 4]
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 5]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!”
Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 6]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame
“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

[Verse 7]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You’ll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

[Verse 8]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
"It’s my work," he’d say, "and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way"
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

[Verse 9]
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 10]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

[Verse 11]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

[Chorus]
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger

Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

To red, blue, and yellow skies

Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried

To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroyed me
But by Friday, I'm revived
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out

Are something I’m having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

But girl I’m black and blue
So beaten down for you
Well I’m beaten down in bloom

Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away

And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well I had no chance to get away
I can’t escape my own escape
Even more when it’s sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh but girl just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well take my crown again
He’s submerged in doubt

But wait, I make my last request
See this could be the best
But blue I need to rest

Only you can cool my desire

The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive

On the way down screamin'

Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time

Building walls to burn them down
Cannonballs to watch me drown
You've got me lost in here and now
You've got me gone and lost and found
We only hang in evenings
And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I know that I won't think it
If I keep up with this thinking
All these dreams and all these plans
We shared under the moonlight
They're dreams and plans that I have
I just don't know if you'll fit right
When I leave in the morning
And I kiss you and say goodnight
I kick myself until we kick it
Should've told you goodbye
Coming home so late at night
With clothes covered in sand
I don't know just what I'm missing
But I'm doing what I can
And if all we have is time then we will find

Interlude:
Boy you are in a hurry!
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at you'd be in a hurry too

Free fallin', fallin'

All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

I want to glide down over Mulholland
I want to write her, her name in the sky
I want to free fall out into nothing
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

Now I'm free

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Bridge]
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me
When you hold me in your arms so tight
You let me know everything's all right

[Chorus]
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

[Verse 2]
Lips as sweet as candy, its taste is on my mind
Girl, you got me thirsty for another cup o' wine
Got a bug from you, girl, but I don't need no cure
I'll just stay a victim if I can for sure

Hear the children crying (One Love!)
Hear the children crying (One Heart!)
Saying: give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Saying: let's get together and feel all right. Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

[Verse 2]
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?
Believe me

[Verse 3]
One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about - ? Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Love!)
So shall it be in the end (One Heart!)
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing!

Let's get together to fight this Holy Armagiddyon (One Love!)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One Song!)

There is no hiding place from the Father of Creation

Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Verse 2]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us

Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only I don't know how
They got out, dear
Turn me back into the pet
I was when we met
I was happier then
With no mindset

[Chorus]
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

[Verse 2]
New slang when you notice the stripes
The dirt in your fries
Hope it's right when you die
Old and bony
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
Never should have called
But my head's to the wall
And I'm lonely

[Chorus]
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

[Verse 3]
Godspeed all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs
And bleed into their buns
'Til they melt away
I'm looking in on the good life
I might be doomed never to find
Without a trust, a flaming field
Am I too dumb to refine?

Lost and afraid, young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is, the easier it scars your soul

My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something

Don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Up and away, I'm an alien, I need a moment
I don't know what to believe
All I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make you see, make you need me?
Maybe I won't ever know, maybe I'll end up alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Running in place (circles, in circles with you)
Don't mind me, out in a race (I didn't mean to be here)

Watch me go
I don't wanna let you down
So, promise you won’t let me drown

[Bridge]
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions about how I've been getting to all these checks
Acting all funny because of the money
It's making my tummy upset
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me a balance
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions are paying the rent, oh
Emotions are paying the rent, oh

When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing

You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Slow it down some, no split, clown bum
Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something has started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?

Bah, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes you can, like can I kick it, wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope Diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit (zzzt!) a rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beats got family members askin' him for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said "Nah fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla jawn?"

Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down

I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips

Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Ooh, yeah I've been flying

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 7/Outro]
When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby, let me take you there
Come on, let me take you there...let me take you there

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
'Cause I, I want honey on my table
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
'Cause I, I want honey on my table

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

[Chorus]
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
And I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

I try to stick this pin through a butterfly
'Cause I, I like all the pretty colors
It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire
To burn with all the others

[Alternative Chorus]
So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, "This will be my victory,"
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea
And now they're stinging my friends and my family
And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

[Instrumental: 03:05 - 6:46]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

[Verse 5: Roger Waters]
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone

So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord, she found me just in time

I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

You surrendered

All is forgiven, baby! Come on, get dressed. You're my date to the pep rally tonight!

You chucked me out like I was trash
For that, you should be dead—
But!
But!
But!
Then it hit me like a flash
What if high school went away instead?
Those assholes are the key!
They’re keeping you away from me!
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can set you free!

You left me and I fell apart
I punched the wall and cried—
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Then I found you changed my heart and set loose all that truthful shit inside!
And so I built a bomb
Tonight our school is Vietnam!
Let’s guarantee they never see their senior prom!

I was meant to be yours!
We were meant to be one!
Don’t give up on me now!
Finish what we’ve begun!
I was meant to be yours!

Pkhw!
Pkhw!
Pkhw!
In the rubble of their tomb
We’ll plant this note explaining why they died!

We, the students of Westerburg High
Will die
Our burnt bodies may finally get through

Your society turns out slaves and blanks
No thanks

‘Goodbye.’

Bring marshmallows
We’ll make s’mores!

We were meant to be one!
I can’t take it alone!

Can't just leave me to bleed!

Veronica, open the—open the door, please
Veronica, open the door
Veronica, can we not fight anymore, please
Can we not fight anymore
Veronica, sure, you’re scared
I’ve been there. I can set you free!
Veronica, don’t make me come in there!
I’m gonna count to three!

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it

When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem it slouched
And then, it must've caught a good look at you

Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?

[Chorus]
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

[Verse 2]
If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my babe?

Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby

Thinking 'bout you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking 'bout you lots lately

[Verse 1: Calum]
Is it bad that I'm hoping that you're broken?
Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunk and on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
All alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya
Is it weird? So weird

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know I’m the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I’m the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots, lately
Or are you moving along?

[Verse 2: Luke]
Is it wrong if I ask you to come over?
Is it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?
Even though I'd never do it when I'm sober
Is it wrong? So wrong

Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me
Scared of moving on, but you’re already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me

Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?

Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land
That you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip

[Chorus 1]
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

[Verse 2]
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man

Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Helplessly hoping
Her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Gasping at glimpses
Of gentle true spirit
He runs, wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye

[Verse 2]
Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?

[Chorus]
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other

[Verse 3]
Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello

They are one person
They are two alone

[Verse 1]
We listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you

[Verse 2]
Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
Your way home

[Verse 3]
Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?
High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
You're going home

[Chorus]
You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates, saying
"I have come home now
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
It's time now, my time now
Give me my, give me my wings"

[Post-Chorus]
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my wings
You are the light and way that they will only read about

[Bridge]
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

[Outro]
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion
Should you see your maker's face tonight
Look him in the eye, look him in the eye, and tell him
"I never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home."

Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by

And did you ever think?
That we could be so close?
Like brothers
The future's in the air

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away(dream away)

And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

The girl in the pastry shop with the net in
Her hair is making a cannoli for you
To take on your hiking trip in the woods with
Your bros that you’ve known since second grade
And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access
To females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious
You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will
Be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth
And that's why you

Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I got a girl to think of even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms
She almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I’m just as scared I don’t know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better
But meeting up in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I’m levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around
I’m like an Indian Fakir tryna’ meditate on a bed of nails with my pants pulled down

Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls

God took a rib from Adam, ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves, microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like “that really hurts”
Going off into the tundra, so pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate the echinacea
Until God said, “I'm a smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two”
And Adam wept and wailed, tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said
“Thank God”

Got a man, don't need him, but you wait

High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

High as hell, feeling fine, nothing bad but nothing kind
Not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind
In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes
Feeling fine, coming down, never back cause we're never out
You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine
In my head, in my head, I get lonely sometimes

I'm nothing more than a page unwritten on the pavement, blowing in the wind
You win a lot, and lose just a little bit more than you gained in the end
But, God, I wish that I, was better than I am, but no luck, no love, no Gospel I could understand
I'm nothing that ever wanted to lean on, yea, but even then

And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
And go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Verse 3]
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his 4's and his 2's
Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Intro]
At six-
For some reason when I go to the app...

[Verse 1]
The comedy of man starts like this:
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so nature, she devised this alternative:
We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since
Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing it's milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

[Chorus 1]
Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just wait until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being
Endowed this horror show with meaning

[Verse 2]
Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks
These unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics
Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony:
Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave
Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive
Is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request
Is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left

[Outro]
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time

[Verse 2]
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal

[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late

When I'm feeling lonely
Sad as I can be
All by myself, an uncharted island
In an endless sea

What makes me happy
Fills me up with glee
Those bones in my jaw!
Don't have a flaw
My shiny teeth and me

My shiny teeth that twinkle
Just like the stars in space
My shiny teeth that sparkle
Adding beauty to my face

My shiny teeth that glisten
Just like a Christmas tree
You know they'd walk a mile
Just to see me smile (Woo!)
My shiny teeth and me

Yes, they're all so perfect
So white and pearly
Brush, gargle, rinse

My shiny teeth, so awesome
Just like your favorite song
My shiny teeth, I floss them
So they'll grow to be real strong

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day sometimes I cry

Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card I'll someday lay
So this is all I have to say

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it grin

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
"Is it to be or not to be?"
And I replied, "Oh, why ask me?"

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I...

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say "I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw", I said "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay"
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while"
He shook his head and then said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

If nobody's around, what's stopping us?
Everywhere I go you show whatever
I don't ever mind sharing oxygen
I just wanna get lost in your lungs

Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast
And I'm allergic to the waiting
She's just a baby girl

Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

I don't think that we should be around each other
When you're in the room, you get my eyes
You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized
I can make you laugh until you cry
You know you got all my attention
You know you got all mine

Even though I shouldn't say it
She was my baby girl
Might never get her back
But I don't mind being patient, yeah

Oh, so
Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

Always looking up for higher floors

Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night, baby come on

[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day

[Verse 2]
And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that

[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break

[Bridge]
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice
Decide on me, yea decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois

[Outro]
Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out

Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me Maurice

Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
Well, don't you worry, baby, don't worry
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner
I play my music in the sun
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I get my lovin' on the run
Whooo
Whooooo

[Verse 2]
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Oee, baby, I'll sure show you a good time

'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner

Well, don't you worry, don't worry, no, don't worry, mama

Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree

"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream", she said
"The one that makes me laugh", she said
And threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

[Verse 2]
Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?", she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?"

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

[Verse 3]
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, just like heaven

But wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around
And say (That)

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Too late, oh, oh

I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new
Yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late

I got a feeling
That you could be feeling
A whole lot better then you feel today
You say you got a problem
Well that's no problem
It's super easy not to feel that way

When you start to get confused
Because of thoughts in your head
Don't feel those feelings!
Hold them in instead

Turn it off, like a light switch
Just go click!
It's a cool little Mormon trick!
We do it all the time
When you're feeling certain feelings
That just don't seem right
Treat those pesky feelings
Like a reading light

[ELDER MCKINLEY (ELDER MICHAELS, ELDER NEELEY)]
And turn 'em off
Like a light switch, just go bap!
Really, what's so hard about that?
Turn it off!

[ELDERS]
Turn it off!

[ELDER CHURCH]
When I was young my dad
Would treat my mom real bad
Every time the Utah Jazz would lose
He'd start a-drinking
And I'd start a-thinking
How am I gonna keep my mom from getting abused?

I'd see her all scared and my soul was dying
My dad would say to me: "Now, don't you dare start crying"

Turn it off

[ELDERS]
Like a light switch
Just go flick
It's our nifty little Mormon trick
Turn it off
Turn

Off

[ELDER THOMAS]
My sister was a dancer, but she got cancer
My doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time, so I got in line
For the (new iPhone) at the Appl(e Store

She lay there dying with my father and mother
Her very last words were "Where is my brother?"

[ELDERS]
Turn it off
Yeah!
Bid those sad feelings adieu
[ELDER THOMAS]
The fear I might get cancer too

[ELDER MCKINLEY & ELDERS]
When I was in fifth grade
I had a friend, Steve Blade (oooh, Steve Blade)
He and I were close
As two friends could be (we could be close)
One thing led to another
And soon I would discover
(Wow
I )was having really strange feelings for Steve
I thought about us, on a deserted island (we're all alone)
We'd swim naked in the sea
And then he'd try and...

WOAH! Turn it off!
Like a light switch
There it's gone
Good for you!
My hetero side just won!
I'm all better now
Boys should be with girls
That's heavenly father's plan
So if you ever feel
You'd rather be with a man
Turn it off!

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
Well, Elder McKinley, I think it's okay that you're having gay thoughts, just so long as you never act upon them

[ELDER MCKINLEY & ELDERS]
No, because then you're
Just keeping it down
Like a dimmer switch
On low
On low
Thinking nobody needs to know!
Uh oh

[ELDER PRICE]
But that's not true!

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Being gay is bad
But lying is worse
So just realize you have
A curable curse
And turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off!

(The ELDERS dance.)

[ELDERS]
Turn it off!

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Now, how do you feel?

[ELDER PRICE]
The same

[ELDER MCKINLEY]
Then you've only got yourself to blame
You didn't pretend hard enough
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes
And find the box that's gay and CRUSH IT!
Okay?

[ELDER PRICE, spoken]
No, no, I'm not having gay thoughts!

[ELDER CUNNINGHAM, spoken]
Alright! It worked!

[ELDERS]
Yay!
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off, turn it off
Like a light switch just go click (click click!)
What a cool little Mormon trick! (trick trick!)
We do it all the time!

When you're feeling certain feelings

[ELDERS]
That just don't seem right
Don't seem right
Treat those pesky feelings

Walking outside labyrinthian
Over cracks along under the trees
I know this town grounded in a compass
Cardinal landing in the dogwood

I keep going over it over and over
My steps iterate my shame
How come every outcome's such a comedown?
Lately afternoon with the shades drawn down

I kept saying I just wanted to see you
Saying, "What's wrong with that?"
Needles shaking outlines in a compass
Every outcome's such a comedown

[Chorus 1]
I knew it when I saw it
So I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it

I saw your boyfriend at the Port Authority
That's a sort of fucked up place
Well so I averted my stride on a quick one
He's coming back from going over to your place, huh?

I feel like I could forget about it
I feel like I could mellow out
I don't feel undone in a big way
There's nothing really bad to be upset about

But when I thought I was getting better
I woke up on the ground
An appointment or disappointment
A setback, oh, another comedown

[Chorus 2]
As if I needed a reminder
Oh, I do only what I want to
So I go through with this

Walking out in the nighttime springtime
Needling my way home
I saw Leah on the bus a few months ago
I saw some old friends at her funeral

My steps keep splitting my grief
Through these solipsistic moods
I should call my parents when I think of them
Should tell my friends when I love them

Maybe I should have gone out a bit more
When you guys were still in town
I got too caught up in my own shit
It's how every outcome's such a comedown

[Chorus 3]
And I knew it when I saw it
Oh, I did just what I wanted
So I go through with this
I knew happiness when I saw it

[Acoustic Intro]
Fuck...

[Verse 1]
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Verse 2]
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

This is a real, this is, excuse me?
Ok, shut up

I buy my own things, I pay my own bills
These diamond rings, my automobiles
Everything I got, I bought it
Boys can’t buy my love, buy my love, yeah
I do what I want (She does), say what you say (Woo)
I work real hard every day

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
I’m a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker
Mmm, yeah

Let's drive around town in my Cadillac
Girls in the front, boys in the back
Loosey as a goosey and we're looking for some fun

I don't need a man to be holding me too tight

[Verse 1]
All my life I've been good
Do what my mom and dad and God say I should
Go to church and Bible School
To live by God's rule
So whatever people tell me
That The Bible tells me
I will do
Walk the halls of high school with my purity ring
Unlike those other girls, I've got my morals in check
It was easy to do until I got a boyfriend
And pardon my French, but he's cute as heck
But I made a pact to keep my hymen intact
And Jesus and I are tight
Never learned about the birds and the bees
I was taught to keep an aspirin in between my knees
'Cause The Bible says premarital sex is wrong
But Jason says that guys can't wait that long
I don't want to lose him to someone who'll do him
I need to figure something out
Well there's a loophole in The Scripture that works really well
So I can get him off without going to hell
It's my Hail Mary, full of grace
In Jesus' name we go to fifth base!
Oh, thank you for making me holy
And thank you for giving me holes to choose from
And since I'm not a godless whore
He'll have to come in the back door
Therefore

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

[Verse 2]
It's hard to be as pure as me
To resist the urge to lose my vaginal virginity
To wait until my marriage bed
To give my husband my unsullied maiden head
So take your cock out
Shove it in my ass
Fuck me until you cum
Oops! I mean let's join our souls
And unite our bodies
And fly with the wings of God
Whatever you do, don't touch my clitoris
If you ring Satan's doorbell, God can't ignore this
And no prophylactics when you put it in
'Cause birth control's for sluts and it's a sin
I've emptied my bowels
And laid out the towels
I'm ready for romance
Now I'm praying to the Power that's the Highest
But of all of my holes, this one's the driest
And we can't procreate if we anally copulate
And God is OK with sodomy, but only if you're straight
And I'm staying pure, no matter what
So I'm OK with everything but...
Everything but...
Everything butt

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a rock hard rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

[Bridge]
I do whatever The Bible tells me to
Except for the parts that I choose to ignore
Because they're unrealistic and inconvenient
But the rest I live by for sure
So let's not talk about how the Good Book bans shellfish, polyester and divorce
And how it condones slavery and killing gays because those parts don't count, of course
Let's cherry-pick the part about losing my cherry and mine it for ambiguities and omissions
To circumvent any real sacrifice, but still feel pious in my arbitrary parroted positions
And don't you dare question my convictions
And don't look closely at the contradictions
Just focus on the sacrificial crucifixion
And have faith in its complete jurisdiction
As the only way to measure if you're good or not
And in a debate, just say to “have faith”
Because when you're up against logic, it's the only card you've got
So close your eyes
Take a deep breath
And...

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of an irrational rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight

I feel the closer we get
To the last bow

I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 2]
There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and

Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me

Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me

Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
"You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity"
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate

Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair

[Verse 5: Colbie Caillat]
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[Intro]
Alrighty, then
Picture this if you will

[Verse 1]
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes
In my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
And me yelping, "holy fucking shit!"
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!

[Verse 2]
Then the X-File being
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
With Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
And my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
And all I could think was
"I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
That I pissed my fuckin' pants"

[Verse 3]
So light in his way, like an apparition, that
He had me crying out
"Fuck me, it's gotta be
The Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got right on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!"

[Verse 4]
And after calming me down
With some orange slices
And some fetal spooning
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose
He said, "You are the chosen one
The one who will deliver the message
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not"
Me, the chosen one
They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school

[Refrain]
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen

[Verse 5]
Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 6]
I can't breathe right now!
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 7]
I can't breathe right now
You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said!
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Verse 8]
I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said
Bob help me!
Can't remember what they said

[Outro]
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know

[Verse 1]
I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm 'bout to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision
So stuck night vision
But I come to life, come to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance

[Chorus]
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, real living, fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind

Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

[Chorus]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load

[Verse 1]
I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Verse 2]
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive

[Chorus]
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (stop)
Back there by the baby grand, did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits, I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits, the chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

He seemed impressed by the way you came in
"Tell us a story, I know you're not boring"
I was afraid that you would not insist
"You sound so sleepy, just take this, now leave me"

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

[Chorus]
Yeah, the night's not over, you're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes, you ran me off the road
The wait is over, I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing, I'm not driving fast enough

[Verse 2]
Now every time that I look at myself
"I thought I told you, this world is not for you"
The room is on fire and she's fixing her hair
"You sound so angry, just calm down, you found me"

[Pre-Chorus]
I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after—
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow."
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

[Verse 2]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "Go slow." I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
And tell, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass
All your girlfriends are wasted
They need it, they chase it
Face it, you want it, you crave it
Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave and Christian Anthony]
Just give me some time and space to realize
That you, were busy lying, sleeping 'round with other guys
And what the hell were we?
Tell me we weren't just friends
This doesn't make much sense, no
But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
'Cause I'll be fine without you, babe (woo)

This syrup keep me coughin'
I got bodies all around me
I swear I see it often
She a devil in a dress
Double Gs on all my clothing
You're the only reason why my heart is always broken
Look at my eyes, look at my eyes so gone
Remember your lies, remember your lies for so long
Too many lies, too many lies to walk on
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights I'm too on

Is it love or is it lust?

Got me going dumb, my heart feeling numb, yeah
Dealing with all this pain, insane in my brain, yeah

You got no heart, baby, you got no heart, yeah
Reptar ate my shit like a shark
Is it love or lust, you should've said that from the start

But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back

Oh Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my head

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

[Chorus]
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

[Chorus 2]
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know

And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

[Verse 2]
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for

[Bridge]
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

Bad Vibes Forever
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Forgive what's said in fear
And all I ask of you is hear
The girl with the golden heart
I killed from the inside out at dawn
The sun's only just arose
Can't amount to all the hearts I've broke
The boy with the broken heart
His goal is to rip everything apart

[Hook: Scott James]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

[Bridge: Scott James]
The oars start sinking
When you let go
To use your hands while speaking
Saying, don't never let us float

Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave even for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

I must have caught your cold
I could not sleep at all
I'm clinging on the ropes
I need you as I'm close

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
But it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around, and I said
"Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"

[Chorus 2]
All he ever wanted
Was to be someone in life that was just like
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like a son of a gun
I could be one thousand miles away
But still mean what I say

[Verse 2]
Then I woke up one morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger’s hair
Never was my style

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around, and I said
“Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say, pretty pimpin'

[Chorus 2]
All he ever wanted was to be a man
But he was always
A little too cute to be admitted under "marbles lost"
He was always a thousand miles away
While still standing in front of your face

[Verse 3]
Then he woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
Then laughed and said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

And I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday

Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror

Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror

Pynk when you're blushing inside... baby

So, here we are in the car
Leavin' traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favorite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Yeah, somethin' like that
Owwww! Somethin' like that

I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna paint the town
I don't wanna hide my love
I just wanna hold your hand and be the one that you think of
When you need a holiday, when you wanna drink rosé
I just wanna paint your toes and in the morning kiss your nose
Cause when I'm with you I don't feel afraid
Maybe this love will indoctrinate
I echo every word that you say
The way you feel, yeah I feel the same way
Remember the night when I combed your hair
I hope I didn't freak you out when I stared
I donate my truth to you like I'm rich
The truth is love ain't got no off switch
So if the walls come tumbling down
And if the ocean really does drown
And if my memories never come back
I'll still remember when we were first was naked at
Picture our faces and new oasis
When we made love we left many traces
Just like the blush thats on your cheeks
Deep inside we're all just Pynk

[Outro: Janelle Monáe]
Pynk, like the inside of your... baby (we're all just pink)
Pynk, like the walls and the doors... maybe (deep inside, we're all just pynk)
Pynk, like your fingers in my... maybe
Pynk is the truth you can't hide
Pynk, like your tongue going round... baby
Pynk, like the sun going down... maybe
Pynk, like the holes in your heart... baby
Pynk is my favorite part

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

And can you feel the love tonight?

No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends round
We're watching the television with no sound"

Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight

Push your lack of chest out
"Look at my hair"
Gotta love the way you love yourself
'Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection on your mental health'

Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends round
You created a television of your mouth

I think I missed you callin' on the other line
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet in my bed

I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone

Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea

Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don’t you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page, it’s chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world’s a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you

[Pre-Chorus]
If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again

[Chorus]
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

[Bridge]
If we hadn't done this thing, I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on our own supply whenever I can
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape from trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape

[Chorus]
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black, I'll stop wearing black
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for a guide
To come and take me by the hand
Could these sensations make me feel
The pleasures of a normal man?
Lose sensation, spare the insults
Leave them for another day
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling
Take the shock away

[Verse 2]
It's getting faster, moving faster
Now it's getting out of hand
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs
It's a no man's land
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing
Getting frequent now
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling
Let it out somehow

[Verse 3]
What means to you, what means to me
And we will meet again
I'm watching you, I'm watching her
I'll take no pity from your friends
Who is right, who can tell
And who gives a damn right now?
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold
Then you know

[Outro]
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling, feeling, feeling

[Intro]
Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

(I'd appreciate your input)

[Verse 1]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

[Verse 2]
Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means "Small Craft Advisory"
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time," you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X-Files"

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

[Bridge]
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it now

[Chorus]
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now


Start of song 


[Intro]
...It's just not right, it's

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh, oh
I just wanna see your face at home, home, home

[Verse 1]
You can't do me right
So I... decide that

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girl no more, no more
I just wanna see you up and out, out of the door, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not living right
So I... decide that

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh oh

[Outro]
I won't hide the ways, I've tried
It's just not right
It's killing me tonight
So, so
