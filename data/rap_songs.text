[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit

[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch (Yeah)

This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big, when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp?

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet
On your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Would you like it better
If I hit the West Coast?
Tell me baby if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip

Get high baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout (Cole World)
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out
I got it, I got it, I got it, listen

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big, it's like a foot is in yo mouth
And you ain't babysittin' but my kids all on your couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'd yo bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg
But I will if I need to, 'cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you
Cole!

Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem

First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, "when you blow up, don't forget me", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', "Who Is Rickey Wayne?"
That me...

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas—

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

It's been racin' since the summertime

And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now

So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now

Yeah, I thought you could wait

All want something out me

Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it

We could've been somebody

Let's take it back to the first party

And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody

She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh

Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight (no, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year
I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smokin' weed and drinkin', all the college students lovin' Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Hun, and as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go ape shit
Say "Fuck y'all!" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I

Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground!
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!"
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you

[Outro: Birdman & Drake]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

Man fuck them niggas I come back, ayy let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, whoa
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait

Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine

This is the part that the thugs skip!

Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more

(The make up) This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment

Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 3: Wale]
Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?

Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)

It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg

From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg (Huh)
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog (Huh)
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg (Huh)
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg (Huh)
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head (Huh)
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds (Huh)
Ten grams off my last 250 now (Huh)
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 (Huh)
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 (Huh)
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 (Huh)
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Verso 1: Paulo Londra]
Mirada fría como la nieve, me congela hasta no dar má'
Si me toca hace que me eleve, hasta ni ver toa' la ciudad
Compraría lo que ella quiere con tal que venga para acá
Estaríamo' como se debe, relajao' sin un problema
Seguro tiene mil pretendientes, pero ni uno valiente
Para hacerle ternuras sin miedo a qué diga la gente
Yo sé bien lo que siente, sé muy bien lo que siente
Que to' somos iguale' con los mismo' errores de siempre

Quemando vemo' el amanecer
Tú-tú-tú-tú-tú (Y salimo')
Con lo' ojo' azule' (-zu', -zule')
Yo con los ojo' rojo' (ro-rojo')
Se te seca la boca y con mi lengua te la remojo (Sh-sh-sh)
Quiero ser Messi y tú mi Antonella
Prepárate pa' vivir una novela
Soy exclusivo, no de cualquiera
Por eso quiero que tú sea' mi nena
Por siempre mi nena; yo'

[Intro: Shawn Lawrence]
"There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

[Verse 1]
Isn't it amazing?
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
Yeah, swanging

[Verse 2]
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging

[Verse 3]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl

Yeah
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (mansion)
I was fightin' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (blastin')
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (we the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (ya dig?)

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, dawg

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room

[Refrain: Drake]
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance

Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't

Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[Break: News Report Sample]
Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight

[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
[Pause] — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related

I finished up my studies and I practiced law

[HAMILTON]
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is

Gentlemen of the jury, I’m curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we’re making hist’ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind
Deliberation—

[ENSEMBLE]
Non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel—

Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That’s all you had to say!

[HAMILTON]
Okay!
One more thing—

[BURR]
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

Write day and night like you’re running out of time?
Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re running out of time
Keep on fighting. In the meantime—

Corruption’s such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony’s economy’s increasingly stalling and

[HAMILTON & BURR & ENSEMBLE]
Honestly, that’s why public service
Seems to be calling me
He's just non-stop!

[HAMILTON]
I practiced the law, I practic’ly perfected it
I’ve seen injustice in the world and I’ve corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I’ll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities

Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

[HAMILTON]
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention!

[BURR]
There as a New York junior delegate:

[HAMILTON & COMPANY]
Now what I’m going to say may sound indelicate… (Awwww)

[BURR & COMPANY]
Goes and proposes his own form of government! (What?)
His own plan for a new form of government! (What?)

[BURR]
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
It’s the middle of the night

[HAMILTON]
Can we confer, sir?

[BURR]
Is this a legal matter?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, and it’s important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, you’re a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, I’m abrasive
You’re incredible in court. You’re succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You’re the solution

[BURR]
Who’s your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

[HAMILTON]
Hear me out

No way!

A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

[BURR]
No one will read it

[HAMILTON]
I disagree

[BURR]
And if it fails?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, that’s why we need it

[BURR]
The constitution’s a mess

[HAMILTON]
So it needs amendments

[BURR]
It’s full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

[HAMILTON]
You’re making a mistake

[BURR]
Good night

[HAMILTON]
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

[BURR]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

[BURR]
Of course

[HAMILTON]
Then defend it

[BURR]
And what if you’re backing the wrong horse?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don’t understand how you stand to the side

[BURR with ENSEMBLE, ENSEMBLE]
I’ll keep all my plans close to my chest
Wait for it, wait for it, wait...
I’ll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
I’m taking my time watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow

[ANGELICA]
I am sailing off to London
I’m accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there’s no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

Don't now, don't stop it

So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut

But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy

I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

[Outro]
Let's get it!
Look, look!
On foenem

[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition, of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back
And saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?)
It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
And black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in the New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Intro: James Fauntleroy + Kendrick Lamar]
Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh
Yeah, uh

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

[Refrain 1]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Verse 1]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 2]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;

[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 3]
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

[Verse 3]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh

[Refrain 3]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 4]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?

Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?

I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us

And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true"
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down"

In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers

That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?

I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

That’s crazy man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes

Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same"
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!

[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life

When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up

If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', "50, you hot" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up"
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'

[WASHINGTON]
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

[JEFFERSON]
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Oww

[JEFFERSON]
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

[HAMILTON]
Not true!

[JEFFERSON]
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York’s in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky

[WASHINGTON & CROWD]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
That's my alcohol!
Secretary Hamilton, your response

[HAMILTON]
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who’s really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in the trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin’ there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you
Where my shoe fits

[WASHINGTON]
Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We’ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
A word

[MADISON]
You don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
You don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Aha-ha-ha ha!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
You’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

[MADISON]
Why he even brings the thunder…

[WASHINGTON]
You wanna pull yourself together?

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

[WASHINGTON]
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your mouth

[HAMILTON]
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

[WASHINGTON]
You need the votes

[HAMILTON]
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

[WASHINGTON]
No, you need to convince more folks

[HAMILTON]
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a nonstarter

[WASHINGTON]
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder

[HAMILTON]
They’re being intransigent

[WASHINGTON]
You have to find a compromise

[HAMILTON]
But they don’t have a plan, they just hate mine!

[WASHINGTON]
Convince them otherwise

[HAMILTON]
What happens if I don’t get congressional approval?

[WASHINGTON]
I imagine they’ll call for your removal

[HAMILTON]
Sir—

[WASHINGTON]
Figure it out, Alexander. That’s an order from your commander

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love

Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do
(Coming down, dripping candy on the ground)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Ramboing these hoes
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless, my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé]
I wake up looking this good
(God damn, God damn, God damn)
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I if I, if I, if I)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me -
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell 'em winning, is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score, before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved
(Uhn!) This every hood nigga dream, fantasizin' 'bout Nicki and B
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, Earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches
UHN! The Queen of Rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
'Cause we A-listers, uh we paid sisters
This watch right here, done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city, with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I'm with some flawless bitches, 'cause they more than pretty
'Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess-cut diamonds, on my Disney
He want "Monster Nicki", in Sri Lanka
I told him, "Meet me at the Trump, Ivanka"

[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah

Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring

Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed

All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you

Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy

Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby

I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road

Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you

Some day, some day, some day
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some day, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday
Back way, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, some days, not gonna please everybody
Some days I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Some days, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do what I wanna, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Woah, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah

And nothin' was the same

Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?

And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real

[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board

You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

Battle Rap (Freestyle)



Verse]
I hear you talkin' shit, bro you think you're the heat
Please bow down to defeat you're barely mince meat
Stop with the street talk, and start to do the street, walk
Lock yourself in and tell me this, how you gonna battle with this sick shit that I spit bitch
See you still flappin' your jaws, prepare to be thrown in the ocean
In the middle with jaws
Or prefer to be served and severed with claws, knock on the doors Of absolute death you may
But please be ready for the automatic failures you may make
So take this and wait for another dismembering, remembering
The tethering of your dream and how it was minced to pieces
Believe in yourself please, to save you now you'll be needin'
Help from Jesus
You think I'm copy, pastin' please, tell me how you're actin' up
Better be quite or I'ma bout to bitch smack your mouth shut
For good, yeah man talk the hood talk better go back and walk the hood walk you ain't had the taste of a real G
Get back down to your level and prepare to be beat
Writin' on your sheet, like you're deep please bitch your weak
You ain't on my level or a level at all, take a vacation
Up the damn wall and fall
Humpty Dumpty, I must be rusty but you better knock the shit Down if you goin' against me
I'm hard to beat, you're hardly cheese compared to these beats And this emcee
You ready, alright, so come on down, I bet you to do it
Let's see if you got the balls or if you're just truant
To me, yeah let's keep an eye, on your ass as the heat intensifies
Talk to me in a smart tone, prepare to meet your demise
Throw you, a hundred million miles is what I'm finna do
Call me Son Goku
I already told you, what I'm gonna do, finna plow through
Yeah man try to tackle a topic more intense then mine
I always rap from the heart, make the fake rappers sigh
But I really really don't give at all a flying fuck
My chance of making this shit is the same as seein' a flyin' truck
Or it could all depend on some serious luck
Maybe I'll release a track that is heard my millions
Make it big and to the top and make billions
But that's a dream for another day, I'm here to take you down
Don't care what you say
Freestylin' this rap shit to the grave
Rap battlin' bitches in my spare time for loose change
Please, all of you fake ass rappers are plan
Make like like a plane and take the next trip away
Far away, from here I don't need to here your shit anymore
I'm tired of it now, next place to be, will be a fuckin' morgue
But let me just let you all know this, I'm sick of it, all of it
So listen next time I write another track
Listen to the facts I spit, and find it through my old wack rap crap
I know I've said some shit, that know I demise
But just look at my own and, your own life
But this time, through my eyes
I got a couple little bitches that need a little call out
But I'll reside, got more and more, don't get me wrong
Now get the fuck back home and call your mom
Continue to rap please, just leave me alone
I'm done hearing wack disses like this
I'm sick of this, listening to this petty as shit
Bitch

[Intro]
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show, won't hurt me now
'Cause heart's been broke, I hate myself
But it won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer,  now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm comin' back
I'll be takin' all the stacks, oh

[Verse 2: Desiigner & Kanye West]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Stacks, oh
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Takin' all the stacks, oh

White X6 looks like a panda

Hundred killers, hundred hammers

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
"Please come back to Rome," you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)

2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common

Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at—

Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
'Cause my niggas still sellin' dope

Campin' out in that corridor, fuck you waitin' on Jordans for?

(Woo!) That's rare, nigga (Woo!) Ric Flair, nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair, nigga
(Woo!) I give this beat the chair, nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta

Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me

I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, "Damn, that makes two of us"
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy."

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)

What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I be in the club standing on the couch
In them Wolf Grey's like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m Hip-Hop Hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I be rockin' J's or
I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m Hip-Hop Hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side

I stay showin' out, my kick game is a beast
I got thirty pair of J's that ain't never been released
Flu game 12, Space Jam 11's
On the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I get trippy, I stay live
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Never waste a ho's time (Freebands)
Bitch, I'm on my own time
Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib

Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'
Bitch, I got the juice and the carbine
Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty
Runnin' with the wave, get you killed quick
Shoot you in your back like you Ricky
Lil Mexico, from no life to afterlife

Red light, green light, red light, green light

We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Bùyào, bùyào"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger

Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm the baby

Brand new whip got no keys

Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, "Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it"
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it

Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah

Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'?", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Uh)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? [sniffing]
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Skit]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love

All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?

Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Strofa 1: Gemitaiz]
È il Gemitaiz te rispondo ancora: "Che voi?"
C'ho ancora un po' de veleno pe' voi
Punta ai grattacieli come la Bad Boy
Flow Makaveli, calo col match point
Il mio flow per te è una tortura
Puoi portare chi ti pare tanto non dura
Fuori bianchi dentro negri come in Honduras
Ne facciamo finché ci schiantiamo col tour bus
Quando entro sulla base questi ancora che mi guardano
Non sono capaci quindi gridano allo scandalo
Sulle basi lente faccio il vandalo
Ricorda che sono una Jordan, tu sei il sandalo
Con due etti divento E.T
Sotto funghetti, se mi permetti
Metto i lucchetti sopra i versetti
Solo se smetti ci fai contenti
Check it, check it, frate' fammi provare
Sputo venti versi col flow particolare
Così se li senti posso farti volare
Pompa questi, esci e molla gli altri, compare
Metto la palla in buca
C'ho il numero 9 come Batistuta
La mia gente parla di merda perché l'ha vissuta
Per questo quando ti sente ogni mio fra' ti sputa
Aumento l'alimentazione, prende fuoco l'alimentatore
Chi si inventa storie gli sputo a rallentatore
Ogni sei parole ti do dipendenza come il metadone
Metà uomo metà clone, faccio il seratone
Sotto il segno del dragone scrivo ogni sera nuove barre
Che per farle impieghi il tempo che il pianeta muore
Frate' di 'sta merda mi hanno appena eletto senatore
Frate' di 'sta merda mi hanno appena eletto imperatore
Quando monto
Sembra di stare in un altro mondo
E pensa che non ci faccio manco molto
Li mando tutti a casa finché gratto il fondo
Flow killer, drug dealer
Non pensare che finisco, ne ho mille
No macchine, no ville
Che te pensi che ho firmato con Skrillex?
Siamo Tanta Roba (Tanta Roba)
Il triangolo
A.k.a. gli altri artisti piangono (scusa)
Dani, sai quanti dischi mancano?
Che prendo una barca
Con tre grammi infilati dentro la scarpa
Sto coi miei fratelli che l'accendono all'alba
Non amo la strada perché vengo da là, fra' (ciao)

[Strofa 2: MadMan]
Le tecniche che cerchi tu? Ciao
Se faccio un pezzo sopra al boom-cha da denuncia
Te ti brucia che spacco
Pure se sbaglio la pronuncia
M un colpo di Mauser, tu un Taser
Quante barre scrause che fate
Vi consiglio delle pause, piangi in ogni singolo
Sembra che hai la sindrome di Münchhausen
Le rime che cerchi non le spunto, le archivio
Fai cagare quando rappi in studio e dal vivo
Se mi spari torno, sono vendicativo
Living dead, Mad il vampiro
Torna dalla morte, da Caronte
Sale dalle catacombe, scala il monte
Il tuo bro scappa forte, sbarra porte
Perché sa che il mio flow è una Colt e spacca calotte
Spingo troppo finché doppio il suono
Fumo l'oppio e chiudo gli occhi, Hiroshima
Scavo tombe tipo l'Etna, salgo in vetta
Sgancio bombe tipo Vietnam, Indocina
Scemo impara la gavetta, tirocina
Ci ricopiano a manetta, tipo Cina
Vi mangiamo tipo le M&M's
M e Gem sono tipo Rei e Kenshiro, voi Shiro e Mila
No io non finisco
Sennò questi dicono che non ho voglia, fanno come quella tipa
Che non dice che è una troia poi si ingoia i miei coglioni
Come dei ravioli perché dice sì come a Valsoia
Quando me li ingoia mentre guido metto la seconda
Lei che mi asseconda, mi diventa tipo una sequoia
Mentre bevo Cognac, cazzo che vergogna
Da mezz'ora giro a 'sta rotonda
Ogni barra è un missile balistico di Putin
Ho lo stile fisico, quantistico, ti chiudi
Per rifarlo pure se è impossibile, ne ho visti tributi
Rappo per altri venti minuti
Metricamente autistico, avanguardistico
Ho fatto lo scientifico, mica l'artistico
Sto con Labadini, gonfio Napapijiri
Davide è di là che gira papiri
(L'accendiamo? Ok, ok, l'accendiamo)
Cappa nella stanza
Fissiamo la ganja che ci pa-ra-lizziamo
La faccia pessima, ma-ciniamo
La traccia a pezzi, guarda chi siamo
Non guardo i prezzi frate' acquistiamo
Altri quattro pezzi di Pakistano
Ci ribaltiamo gli occhi al contrario
Che ti impattiamo è lapalissiano
Sto a mille, guardami che brucio le papille
Sulla base non indugio, serial killer
Voglio demolire, che ti devo dire?
Voglio solo morire alle Antille
Non mi voglio accontentare
Rappo tipo lama per accoltellare
Ogni barra è la mia dama da contemplare
Da domani Ramadan ho troppe pare
Fra' c'ho la madama che è pronta a entrare

[Outro: MadMan]
Ahaha, che cazzo devo dire? Devo anche aggiungere qualcosa?
Mio fratello Gemitaiz, Veleno parte 6
La cazzo di leggenda continua, er veleno nun finisce mai

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile
With her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan-fried, sun-dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tight, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move it slowly
Taking in my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move slowly
Taking in my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget,  I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute
Let me take my butt to church

[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move it slowly
Taking in my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move slowly
Taking in my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
Slowly
Taking my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

[Bridge: Jamila Woods and Others]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain

Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Refrain]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it

Stay another day for it

And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?

Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?

Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...
Would you fuck me for free?

One time for 40
One time for Drake

Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Who’s asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I’m Alexander Hamilton, I’m at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
I’m getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It’s a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I’m not stupid

So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parents’ dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
You’re an orphan. Of course! I’m an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we’re worth more
Than anyone bargained for…

Can I buy you a drink?

That would be nice

Talk less

[Intro: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
$now Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all

[Bridge: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit
Thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch

[Outro: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye [Laughter]

Way up north, packed in Honda cars

[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned

Hypebeasts we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my nigga

Got that strong, my nigga
Then come match that shit with me
Smokin' mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches 'bout that money (Cash Out)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck with no snitches
So don't tell me who tellin'
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Mama always told me: "Boy, count your blessings."
In God I trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this
Let me give your ass a checklist
One gold watch, two gold chains
Six gold rings, it's nothin' (Goddamn!)
OG Jordans, them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stuntin' (Okay!)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used that shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

Real love, ain't that something rare
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Real love, yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin' 'bout a real love

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain

If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you

If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick

Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying "Fuck you," "I miss you," or "I hate you so much"
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say "Be real," I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, "Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?"
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)

You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah, we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna & Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know

I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt

Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name

And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'

Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it

Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy

And I rock seventeen, all these knots in my jeans
Me and Zoo turnin' up, got your boo in the cut
And she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
Cause baby you the baddest, all this money, I'ma cash it
And I'm swervin' all in traffic
While I'm trapping out the mansion
And I'm moving through the tri-state
Do two-hundred on the highway
And I'm swerving in my i8
Baby, you should come my way

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack

Southside, Southside on the, Southside on the, hey
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage, I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 2]
So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know, they bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I grew up in the streets without no heart

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen

Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?

I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?

I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like

Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—See? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you, damn…

Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids!
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
Ha, I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

[Chorus]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch

[Intro]
Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

[Verse]
Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, "I'm On One"
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

[Outro]
Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer

I ain't really mean to say, "On my dick"
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it

'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)

Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, "¡Olé!"
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, "Fuck trial"
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way

[Bridge 1: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—

[Verse 2]
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Ah, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in,my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck?
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothin' but a buckshot, ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist

Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild

You’ll never feel so…

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)

Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?, truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit

Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick, ho

I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like "nah"

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call

I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

Ugh, what the fuck?

How his dick staying perched up on his balls like that?
Walking down the street and ain’t nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain’t no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain’t nobody judging 'cause I’m black or my controversial past
I’ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I’m a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I’m in Dicky’s body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter’s in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I’m tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I’m balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I’m at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won’t let me in
I don’t know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me

I go hard in the booth, Biggie vibes, gimme the loot
I'm a classy millionaire, bitches ain't got the couth
C-O-U-T-H 'cause you can't spell it either
If I call him then he comin' home runnin', Derek Jeter
Bitches must be eatin' ass because I swear they're bottom feeders
Ho, you know that you my son, I shoulda scrapped you as a fetus
All these bitches rockin' inches 'cause they followin' the leader
I should switch it up on hoes and rock a Afro like Lupita's
I don't keep up with the Joneses, but I do know Catherine Zeta
I'm with Candice, TT, Thembi, and Viola, mi amiga
Rap bitches, they gotta check in with the Queen
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between, uh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ride with Minaj, mmh Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain

Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)

You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong

Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet"
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

She keep my wishes well, I don't need her, well
Oh, yeah, how my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off of my energy?

Foreign bitch that think she into me

[Verse 1]
Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

[Verse 2]
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

[Verse 3]
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

[Verse 4]
Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo', Holmes, smell ya later"
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)

Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga

Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went

You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only 13 when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Chorus]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

Got me saying, "What's good with you?"

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should’ve knew better

But still I'm saying, "What's good with you?"

Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you

Notice that this man did not have his hands up

I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie

Yeah, I guess a nigga just believe in you and that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you
I'll do it for you, that's real

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I want you
To turn up on me every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you
Hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do
Even look like Lauren Lo too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
'Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain’t trippin' off of any of your niggas
'Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
Girl, I see you

[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn

Let's have a toast for the scumbags

And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long

The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
(So excit—so excit—so excit—so excit—)

Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause

I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

I can't speak

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

(But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it’s fuckin’ awesome)

2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it

See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

That coca

[Chorus: NAV]
I just poured an 8 in a liter
Throw some Jolly Ranchers in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snorting three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rolling off Molly
Got a white bitch snorting up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more

[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured a 8 in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch looking for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause their main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more
Your girl is a ho, you need to let go
She fucked all my bros, she's snorting the snow (That coca)
Now she's touching her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more
Fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

Drove back to the hood, Lambo (Ooh)

Riding around the city with my eyes closed (Yeah, yeah)
Crazy Girls got it popping, AOD got it popping (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna text my accountant
Ain't no service in the mountains (Straight up)
Won't you come to the bottom?
Know you heard a lot about 'em (Yeah)
Heard they take that then they change like a mood ring (Yeah, yeah)

Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "we" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no
Yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us

So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!

If you really want some smoke, you can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make your nigga eat me out

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West,  Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]

I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand, huh
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame-ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys, yeah
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper]
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"
There he go

Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexin' on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy

Well he mad as fuck, when they sex, she scream for me, ayy
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy

I never mind, girl, that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this

'Cause you know I'm okay

When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 1: Drake]
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

[Bridge: Drake]
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?

They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got

Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Verse 2: Kelly Price & Choir]
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, "Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'"
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

[Refrain: The-Dream, The-Dream & Choir, Natalie Greene]
(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war

You see the wings on every pair
All you see is Remy Boyz

You know where we came from
You don’t want sauce, no A1

Ayy, she a cutie and she fine, make me wanna make her mine

Blowing, pluck it out the window
We get playing, press rewind, got her singing every time
Take a high note for me, girlfriend
Got my city looking rude

[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Chorus: Kanye West & Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir]
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Verse: Kanye West & Kelly Price]
Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi, Pastor T.L. Barrett / Choir & Kelly Price]
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk

[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"

A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?"
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

Now
Walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"

Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Only got 20 dollars in my pocket

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

From that thrift shop down the road

I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I’m in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on!)

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, whoa...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: KYLE]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screenin' out the lane
Went from "Damn, this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: KYLE]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up

Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”

“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”

There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution

Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on

Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 1]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2]
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 2]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time

[Verse 3]
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines."
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
As I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 1]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Bridge]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (To bust) (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us

Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online, that ain't part of my day

I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah

I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies

Y'all don't wanna see Win Win, 50 or Whoa
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones wit' me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see 'em, somethin' wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne
Yeah, run 'em

[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Lo mein)

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)

Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause—

[Chorus]
You know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
You know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'

Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'

[Intro: 2Pac]
I ain't got no motherfuckin' friends
That's why I fucked yo' bitch, you fat motherfucker!
(Take money) West Side, M.O.B., Bad Boy killas
(Take money) You know who the realest is
(Take money) We bring it too
(Take money)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

[Chorus: 2Pac]
See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up! (Yeah)

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'ma let my little homies ride
On you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches, feel it!

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, ha ha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL, fuck you too!
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
(Take money, take money)
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow!
Motherfucker, my .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life ridas
Westside 'til we die!
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers! We do our job!
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob!
Ain't nothin' but killas
And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh 'cause our staff got guns under their motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!

To my lover, I'd never lie
He said "be true," I swear I'll try

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)

We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Cross my heart, hope to die

I am his, and he is mine

Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & (Lalah Hathaway)]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black

How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Dites-moi d'où il vient
Enfin je saurai où je vais
Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien
On finit toujours par trouver
Elle dit qu'il n'est jamais très loin
Qu'il part très souvent travailler
Maman dit "travailler c'est bien"
Bien mieux qu'être mal accompagné

Dites-nous qui donne naissance aux irresponsables ?
Ah dites-nous qui, tiens
Tout le monde sait comment on fait des bébés
Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas
Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait hérité, c'est ça
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?
Dites-nous où c'est caché, ça doit

[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge: Kanye West]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West, Frank Ocean & Kóbor János]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo
Yeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high
H-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt (mhm-igh)
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét

("Fuck all you hoes!" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me

[Outro: Drake & Lauryn Hill]
Gotta hit the club like you hit them, hit them, hit them angles
It's a short life, yeah
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Alright, alright. That’s what I’m talkin’ about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!

[ANGELICA, ALL MEN, ALL WOMEN]
A toast to the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the groom!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!
To the bride!

[ANGELICA, ALL MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN]
From your sister
Angelica!
Angelica!
Angelica!
Who is always by your side
By your side!
By your side!
To your union
To the union! To the revolution!
And the hope that you provide
You provide!
You provide!

[ANGELICA, HAMILTON AND MEN, ELIZA AND WOMEN]
May you always... (Always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)

[Recorded Samples]
Rewind, Rewind
Helpless, sky's, sky's
Drownin' in em
Drownin', rewind

I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I remember that—

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place

But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game…

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where’s your fam’ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…

[ANGELICA]
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I’m about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I’ll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She’d be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

[ANGELICA]
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

[ANGELICA, ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON), ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

So turn the volume loud

Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me,

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."

Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it

[Verse 1: Wale]
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!

He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen

Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide

If we manage to get this right
They’ll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander…

Is that the one fighting for your soul?

Oh, God! Whoa, okay

It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge: Ray Dalton and Macklemore]
Na na na na, na na na na (Huh-uh)
Hey (And all my people sing)
Na na na na, na na na na (Hey, hey, that's right)
Hey (Here we go, all right, uh)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na (You do it, Ray)
Oh (Ha-ha, let's go)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more!

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment (Ooh)
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over (Ooh)
So we put our hands up (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)
Like the ceiling can't hold us (Ooh)

Hit that shoulder lean

All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]

Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (Here you go, ayy)
Back it on me (Back it up)
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (On me)
She waited on me (And what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (Wait up)

[Verse 1]
Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "Just listen"

[Chorus]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't

Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed

[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date." — "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!" — "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake

You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]

With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys

Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (remember)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

'Cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me (woo!)
Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse
But man, that's not a swap to me (nah!)
Drownin' in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis (Metropolis?)
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man, I guess I'm a optimist (milli!)
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us (go!)
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars, boy

We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace

"What the fuck is he plannin'?" (What?)
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy (go, go!)
Started a label, the album is comin' September
Just wait on it (just wait on it!)
This year I'm eatin' your food
And my table got so many plates on it (so many!) (damn!)
Hundred-inch TV at my house
I sit back like "Damn, I look great on it!" (damn, I look good!)
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga
Don't ask for my take on it (don't ask for my opinion!)
Speakin' in lingo, man, this for my nigga
That trap out the bando (bando, bando!)
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano (brr, brr, brr!)
Fuck all your feelin' 'cause business is business
It's strictly financial (business is business!)
I'm always the first one to get it, man
That's how you lead by example (I got it!)
Versace, Versace

Word in New York is the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me Papi (woo, woo)

Codeine sippin', Versace, I'm grippin'
Them bands in my pocket, you know that I’m livin'
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs: that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload

I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Ride with me, ride with me, boss (boss)
I got a hard head, but her ass soft (soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats

I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit

Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada-

Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (Eeoow)

You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazy (Okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden? (Huh?)
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit (Wooh)
The red light, red light stop, stop (Skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage (Carriage)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean "pop-pop-pop," then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist

Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em "Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us"

Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag

Gucci airbag just in case we crash

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?

I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league."
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient
Love is kind

Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (ooh)

Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

I am the one, don't weigh a ton

Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

Man I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god, church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one

And now you want my fame?

All these beefs I just ran through, hit a milli in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio is all rollin'

We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past

Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

[Verse 6: Jake Paul]
Is that your boy's cologne?
Started balling', Quicken Loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, they all copy me
But, that's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said it's 10 with six zeros
Always plug, merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro
Peace

[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

Hop out, do you bang?

Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor ima die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!

So I ball so hard mothafuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a mothafucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets to BK

[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all"
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) "Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around mothafuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga?
What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
'Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh

No one knows what it means, but it's provocative

Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling

How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone

You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much

You're so unfair

Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

And you take the blade right out my heart

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you

Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole

I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is bands

I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that

Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo
Lambo Murciélago

Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 2 Chainz]
Let the suicide doors up

I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (Yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (Baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (Damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (Rain) pourin' (Pourin')
All my cars is foreign (Foreign)
All my broads is foreign (Foreign)
Money tall like Jordan

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it

Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I dont gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, "Get ahead of them niggas!"
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she askin' “Why you say that?!”
I'm chillin' (Yeah), real nigga feelin'
Rich kid asshole, paint me as a villain (Ma!)
Still spitting that cash flow, DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those
Why though? 'Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo (What)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese (Yeah?)
Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't coppin' these, niggas ain't lookin' like me (Nah)

Different color, my passport
Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear, and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
“Err-eh-err-eh,” onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! (Tailor-made!)
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade (Gatorade)

"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance." (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it." (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet (Work)
Stand up! (Work)
Ferg!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa (baby)
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg (damn!)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Chorus]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland
12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal
I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothin' but work (put it in work)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28
Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y, I'm in your state
Eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay
Super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip
She say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' (argh argh), ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress
Side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"

[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no

Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches

'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'ma get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the—

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are—meant to be…

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

[HAMILTON & LAURENS]
And I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
I am not throwing away
My shot (my shot)
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
And I'm not throwing away my shot

[HAMILTON/MULLIGAN/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you say, 'anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my—

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a—

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[LAURENS]
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another—

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

[LAURENS]
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

Come on!
Yea
Come on, let's go!

Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

[LAURENS AND ENSEMBLE & COMPANY]
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
Rise up! (Rise up!)

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag

I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
"I think my dad's gone crazy," yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be 46 years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout "I'ma call up Trick Trick"
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck "Rap God," I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it (Ayy!)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go on Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' 50
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff?
When you the one that called Diddy (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brra!)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help!)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up!

He like, "Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me."
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy!)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

[Bridge]
Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells!

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
"I'm not afraid," okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8" and I'm 6'4", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr!)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you! (Thank you!)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy!)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh!)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim!

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)
I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Part I: "Sing About Me"]

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

(On the phone)
"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."
"Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
[Hangs up]
"Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works."

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe you raised Him from the dead."
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior."
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward."
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus name, amen."
(In Jesus name, amen)

Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me

Everywhere she go they playin' my song

[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)

Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul

That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really 'lone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic

Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]

Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

[Intro: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (goddamn)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (goddamn)
Yeh, I know your baby mama fond of me (goddamn)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli (goddamn)
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me (goddamn)
Tell her I can get that pussy easily (goddamn)
Tell her I can hit that shit so greasily (goddamn)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (damn)

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, ayy
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna, hey I'm beyond, ayy, ayy
Said I'm beyond all that fuck shit, ayy

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, "Okay you're special"
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the "why you got to stare" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli
(my weed, my weed)
Yeah, I know your baby mama fond of me (she fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(the weed, the weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
(she runnin' for)
Said that I can get that pussy easily
(she fallin' for)
Said I can hit that shit so greasily (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (yeah)

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again

I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Breaking news, my niggas

Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game
Right, right, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier

Aw man

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
Side-side to side
This task, a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Heads up
You hear a sound, turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh, no, it's you again
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes-eye-eyes

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Stuff again-gain)

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Just when you think you're safe
Overhear some hissing from right behind
Right-right behind
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time
Time-time-time-time

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Blows up
Then your health bar drops and you could use a one-up
Get inside, don't be tardy
So, now you're stuck in there
Half a heart is left, but don't die, die, die
Die-die-die

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)

Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again

[Verse 3: CaptainSparklez]
(Creepers, you're mine, haha)
Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
And make some armor, get it, baby
Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me, bro, huh
Training in your room under the torchlight
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
Every single day and the whole night
Creeper's out prowlin', hoo, alright
Look at me, look at you
Take my revenge, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm a warrior, baby, what else is new?
And my blade's gonna tear through you, bring it

[Bridge: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
(Gather your stuff, yeah, let's take back the world)
Yeah, baby, tonight (Haha)
Grab your sword, armor and go (It's on)
Take your revenge (Woo), oh-oh, oh-oh
So fight, fight, like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, show them your bite (Woo)

[Chorus: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel and bolt again (Bolt again-gain, woo)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight (Come on, swing your sword up high)
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Come on, jab your sword down low)

Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman

[Verse 1]
May lakad ka ba mamaya?
Puwede ka ba makasama sa pag-gagala
Kung sakaling 'di ka puwede
Sabagay, meron din akong ginagawa
Siguro nga napapaisip ka
Ba't ako nangangamusta
Ilang araw ka nang naroon sa panaginip ko
Nag-aalala lang ako baka sa'n ka mapunta
Pero mukhang ayos ka naman
Kahit 'di na kita abalahin pa
Ilang ama namin pa ba ang dapat
Para patago kang mag-alala sakin (uh)
Habang pinapantasya lamang nila
Ay mascara mo sa gabi At
Pitaka mo sa umaga
Yung "ikaw" sa likod ng kolorete
Pa din ang nangangahulugan
Sa salitang "paraiso" para sakin
Bakit kaya kayamanan ko pading kinikilala
Ang iyong pagtawa
Kahit na sa puso mo man ay
Ilang dosena na din ang kasya
Dati pa 'kong pinagdamutan ng kapalaran
Kaya 'di na bago sakin mawalan ng pag-asa
Ala-una ng umaga na naman
Tawagan mo na lang ulit ako
Kapag hindi na kayo magkasama

[Verse 2]
May lakad ka ba mamaya
Sana madaanan mo ko pagkatapos
Sabihin mo ngayon ako'y makaka-asang
Dito ka dadalhin ng iyong sapatos
Kung ngayong gabi lang naman ang magiging dahilan
Ay handang-handa padin naman ako mamaos
Nakakaluwag ka man ay sa mas
Nakakalibang na paraan kita tutulungang makaraos
Bakit ka nagparamdam
Siguro 'di na kayo nilanggam
Ba't kaya 'di niya alam
Ang iyong halaga't kung ga'no ka kalinamnam
Iniwasan ko ma'ng matakam nang di halata
Ang hirap na magpabaya
Kapag tawag na ng laman ay nagbadya
Makipaglangit-lupa ng walang taya
Mata sa mata, bibig sa bibig
Mga ingay na tayo lang dalawa nakadinig
Nakatawang umidlip sa kama
Pero ba't wala ka na pagsapit ng umaga?

You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

[Verse 1]
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it. Oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail

Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

[Verse 1]
You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin +  2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talkin', we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind ya back like nunchucks and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She's blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turnt a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance
Ho, what's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, 187
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, Promethazine with Codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch, that pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt, RIP — Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...

[Verse]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

[Chorus]
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday

Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy

[Bridge]
It ain't no way no how
I made it on my own, I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go
You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

[Chorus]
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
Got the club going up on a Tuesday

Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Kanye West]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholeseller
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah + Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo!) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Hah)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuuugh!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what y'all talkin’ bout
And my eagle — still got it all in the bag, B
Yeah, all I did was play possum
Yo, come on

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
600 Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven’t ate since 12, and it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like 40 chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)

Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Take you places other niggas can't take ya

I'm still trapping every day, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

Said I ain't never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rockstar
That blunt ash on the floor
Well, she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know, toke
Took a drag out that 'Wood, now she goin' for my wood
So we goin' to my hood, yeah, she gonna get it good

Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more

'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?

More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

Now, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it

We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it

[Bridge: Drake]
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it

[Bridge: Drake]
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?

[Chorus: Detail]
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it

Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down

You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore

[Verse]
Can’t stop, won’t stop, get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip-flops
Manicures and pedicures, I’m always tip-top
When they say I’m not hot, all these lies need to stop
'Cause I’m icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I’m rollin’ with some Gucci, bitch I might be
It’s very unlikely my wrist ain’t looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey
Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I’m about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I’m living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed? I’m tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I’m taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I’m always where I’m suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I’m knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me? I’m probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that’s how I keep my sanity
Yeah, it’s my team's summer
Couple setbacks, bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I’m out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I’m chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G’s, let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat
Never ever, thats how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don’t got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I’m someone that they know
I’m the big cat bitch, yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be

[BURR]
Ah, Mister Secretary

[HAMILTON]
Mister Burr, sir

[BURR]
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

[HAMILTON]
No

[BURR]
You know Clermont Street?

[HAMILTON]
Yeah

[BURR]
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

[HAMILTON]
Sure

[BURR]
And all he had to do was die

[HAMILTON]
That’s a lot less work

[BURR]
We oughta give it a try

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?

[HAMILTON]
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you

[BURR]
Really?

[HAMILTON]
“Talk less. Smile more.”

[BURR]
Ha

[HAMILTON]
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

[BURR]
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

[HAMILTON]
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

[MADISON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go

[BURR]
But—

[HAMILTON]
Decisions are happening over dinner

[BURR]
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Diametric’ly opposed, foes

[BURR]
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Previously closed

[ENSEMBLE]
Bros

BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:

[BURR & ENSEMBLE]
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
The room where it happened
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
No one really knows how the game is played (Game is played)
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made (How the sausage gets made)
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in
The room where it happens. (The room where it happens.)

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander said—

[HAMILTON]
I’ve nowhere else to turn!

[JEFFERSON]
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
I approached Madison and said—
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

[BURR]
But!
No one else was in—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

[BURR]
No one else was in—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

[BURR & COMPANY]
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss (Parties get to yesssss)
The pieces that are sacrificed in (Ev’ry game of chesssss)
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in (The room where it happens)
The room where it happens

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Meanwhile—

[BURR]
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

[COMPANY]
Meanwhile—

[BURR]
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

Company screams in chaos

[BURR]
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

[MADISON]
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—

[JEFFERSON]
Oh-ho!

[MADISON]
A quid pro quo

[JEFFERSON]
I suppose

[MADISON]
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?

[JEFFERSON]
Actually, I would

[MADISON]
Well, I propose the Potomac

[JEFFERSON]
And you’ll provide him his votes?

[MADISON]
Well, we’ll see how it goes

[JEFFERSON]
Let’s go

[BURR]
No!

[COMPANY]
—one else was in
The room where it happened

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

[BURR]
My God!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

[BURR]
And no one else was in the room where it happened

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

[HAMILTON]
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot

[BURR]
You got more than you gave

[HAMILTON]
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

[HAMILTON]
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me

[HAMILTON/JEFFERSON/
MADISON/WASHINGTON & COMPANY]
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
If you stand for nothing (What do you want, Burr?)
Burr, then what do you fall for? (What do you want?)

[BURR]
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

[BURR & COMPANY]
I I wanna be in
The room where it happens

I’ve got to be (I wanna be in)
I’ve got to be (The room where it happens)
In that room (The room where it happens)
In that big ol’ room (The room where it happens)

[COMPANY]
The art of the compromise—

[BURR]
Hold your nose and close your eyes

[COMPANY]
We want our leaders to save the day—

[BURR]
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away

[COMPANY]
We dream of a brand new start—

[BURR]
But we dream in the dark for the most part

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Dark as a tomb where it happens

[BURR & COMPANY]
I’ve got to be in
The room… (The room where it happens)
I’ve got to be...
The room where it happens
I’ve got to be...
The room where it happens
Oh, I’ve got to be in

[Intro: J. Cole]
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number, I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage, Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la Renta
Your hijo pequeño, my nachos bel grande
Stay sippin' that André, spent three stacks, that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim, they say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say: breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire, trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time, you Hyundais
Y'all couch niggas, we stand on 'em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-Boys still ball the same, just gotta little bit of glam on it
Yah!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
Yo, I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic, I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says, "What's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a looney (Uh)
Wish upon a star (So what's up?)
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
'Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that Category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste, nigga
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
'Cause if music and money is the motive, then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin', I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Go, go, go, go-go (Uh), go, go, go, uh
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: RetcH]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', this pill got me open
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke, but tell Butter roll a blunt
'Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try 'em
He'll call me RetcH, but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trappin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin' (What?)
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trannies 'cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine on chill and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in L.A. with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit, Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
Four gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' the shit, so avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to rain
Get love in the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of Hell's Kitchen praying he don't stick to the stove
God got me, illumi-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
Buy 150, let me tell y'all now, I want Nikki
Lift her up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play Problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (What)
Keep fresh just in Margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (Naw!)
Compton niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
Know once it's almost over tryin' to jerk the wheel
You nervous, like them cutters he'd inject the speed
And you think you mothafucka faking me, my nigga? (What)
Yeah I bet a nigga crawl to the crown
I'm a boss, hire hoes while I bottle out
I see them niggas shaking hands and biting styles
Got her to stay city in 'cause I fired her spouse
'Cause I'm a mad man
Just fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the Sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (Diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no Js
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter, Chachi-palooza
Riding shotty in the Chevy bitch old as a cougar
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy use the porthole please
Get it good girl, use your knees, I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (For real)
Back on my Compton shit, demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (Huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (What)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(Check!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's two or three and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button (Beep)
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223 (Do, do, do ,do)
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key (Uh-huh)
Bitch we great, bitch we great (Great), fuckin' set (Set)
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get, get, we gotta get, get, we gonna take it first
We jump, said bitch we jump, we gotta make it (Yeah)
Couple racks up on them Wikki stiks
Yo bitch, she smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink 'til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga, all I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga, mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal, NY, them eagles
Fly through, get high too, fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group, come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin, boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun poundin', keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me, me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up, that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up, Hennessy, Louis V
Me and you, me and her, we as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one, freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since eight and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "Nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk butter like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado]
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room, legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon? All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack, just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening, now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls, redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up, wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor, burning monks to feel the timbre
Part of the action, retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them, watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, three grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want, I'm a zombie, bitch, I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo', Prada never gonna pile up if you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meechy Darko]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga, let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know, niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lecter
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible, I've been on my mind for days
'Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill King
Niggas stay shot, shit stay locked, I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game, let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real West Side nigga, 4.2 bitch
They might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
Your bitch put me high up on a nigga to-do list
You can do that, fuck nigga do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on gay shit
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's Prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Erik Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz? I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the MAC, truck bulletproofed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of Pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz? My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once, no voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Bimmer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Ninas
Instead, I was that nigga puffin' reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
'Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga gripper of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the worst you'll see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome, your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back, cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb and I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man, I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang, I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame, I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride, hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die, pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest, right now chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate", if I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to while I'm fine dining on YouTube, bruh
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with a Onyx on, Nefertiti on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing, these rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter, one two, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something, I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable, make sure it ain't sitting on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body, fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up, I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry, in backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are, I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you, then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger! Y'all got me drunk as hell, uh
Now I been red since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your bitch in the 'Lac, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, and you can roll it, roll it
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see I'm servin' foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody else to eat but her
She be like fuck them bitches, stack the digits
Compliment this Fendi fit, condiment or sentimental
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprint on my golds, they all on the seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe ring, featured by E
Bitches know it's time out
This bitch be fucking me so good, I be like, "Time out!"
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
And how she stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like, "Time out!"
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant 'gar, she tall like 'Zilla, I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked, no pajamas
Lil' homie ranned off with lots of lumber
For that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a bean together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growin' wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my thing together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Mykko Montana, my father say I got stamina
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na, I bury these hoes like sandals them
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yellow pages, just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian Mercedes
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it and right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh, my nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day one hundred, cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit, you just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out faster than cancer sticks
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar, Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face, hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you, real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit, it's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: CUZ Lightyear (a.k.a. SL Jones)]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Looked like Joan, we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes,I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit, pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader, still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa? Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga, that's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
As far as everyone goes, they can suck and kneel on it
We have another song, gotta fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit, my Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson, I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic, paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the Philly
My daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep, that's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, I'm spending
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
Despite sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
It's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em, I don't write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressin'
Scorin' high off the fresh pressses, brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good, I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper and she gave me the sloppy goooood
So you should tip her if you execute, young leisure suit
Larry with no extra loot, my ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', me like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemies
Yo what's up, see me on motherfucker tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum (drum)
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn, no shit, not zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn no shit zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz]
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah, motherfucker, I got it right here, I got it right here
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah muthafucka, I-- muthafucka I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
I said most of these niggas gon' hate, me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon swing, we all gon catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap, Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase, but I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time, you ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die, I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh, big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending, been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
But to our niggas, we gettin' it with that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a cake to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris, and free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off Rocky, rottweiler just to watch it
Maybachs for the profit, get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers, press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing, no tags, nigga, fuck the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne, and a 3 page spread
I was sleepin' on the flow, just a couple months later
Now I'm purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, gold for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
Target my ankh, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be ending me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A Black Clan king, respect the illustrator
Don't you dare ever try the Elohim, fuck flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up kid, put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, kill this shit
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
Gotta check up, haters still sick
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
And ya bitch came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn, the fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm all but the limousine
Swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene, yeah, that's a Spit 16
Hearts inside of my tip jar, like a bleedin' heart beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin' then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like Vans, I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans, go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross for all of that 15 minute fame
But I'ma get in your ears and the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip and just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork, I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit with a pistol, dro is full of his disorders, I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My broad on da eastside ho nigga
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it, flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it, running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID, game need me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Commander and chief, my sons is Son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know? So much wax in this blunt I'm smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
You think I'm fuckin' mad, I'm too so
I'm out of it, bitch, oh, nah, fuck that
Bring them fuckin' trumpets back
Light a dub sack for my niggas who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
Fucker I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you

Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT

I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

[Chorus]
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"

You feel some type of way, then a-ha!

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Free Remy!
(Word)
You know what? Free Remy!
Fuck you, Free Remy!
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you dumb?
You wore a pink diamond chicken wing chain (Are you dumb?)
You had a leopard beehive on your head (Are you dumb?)
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)
Are you forgettin' that I pressed you before, bitch?
(Fuck Nicki Minaj!)

[Hook]
(I) Fuck with your soul like shETHER
(Will) You ain't the queen, I'll show you
(Not) Lipo your ass and belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
They told you your whole career
I'd come home and kill you, right? Ha-ha!

[Verse]
I told you I wasn't talkin' about your dumb-ass
It looks stupid, you literally got a dumb ass
Talkin' cray, and we all know that you dumb as
You get Donkey of the Day, yeah, you dumb ass
Let's be honest, you stole that line 'bout bitches bein' your sons
How you take my '09 jail tweet and run?
Talkin' about bringin' knives to a fight with guns
When the only shot you ever took was in your buns
And I saw Meek at All-Star, he told me your ass dropped
He couldn't fuck you for three months because your ass dropped
Now I don't think y'all understand how bad her ass got
The implants that she had put in her ass popped
I was like, "Damn, 90 days and you couldn't have box?
Did she at least compensate? Start givin' you mad top?
Her name Minaj, right? She ain't throw you some bad thots?"
He said "Nah," that's when I knew you was really a trash bop
You was screamin' "Free Remy!" when I was upstate doomed
But now that they freed Remy you don't sing the same tune
Locked me up, threw away my keys, threw away my weaves
Snatched me from my son, braids to the back, state greens
Daily News, "Her career's over," "She was kinda stupid,"
But you saw a opportunity 'cause you a opportunist
Left your Day 1 'cause you heard he was on some cheat shit
Then got with the dude that told you on some creep shit
But what happened to Omeeka? Nah, on some G shit
Left him and took a pic with the dude he had beef with?
And we all know it was a beef that you started
Pillow-talkin' out of your ass, this bitch retarded
Now you gotta die, you dearly departed
Bloodbath when I catch you, a real red carpet
Now what I'ma do, I'ma just stick to the facts
Bitch so scared of my future, got this bitch goin' backwards
Been through mad crews, you disloyal hoochie
Now all of a sudden you back with Drake and Tunechi?
After he said you sucked his dick, you back with Gucci?
Who next: Puff, Deb or Fendi? You a A-list groupie
And to be the Queen of Rap, you gotta actually rap
The whole industry know that your shit is a wrap
No, to be the Queen of Rap, you can't have a ghostwriter
And that's why this is my house; Flo Rida
Niggas done seen Drake pennin', Wayne pennin'
And since your first boyfriend left, bitch ain't winnin'
You a Internet troll, a Web browser, I'm sorry
You can't get a on line without Safaree
Mentionin' guns, you Pussy Galore, James Bond
Only time you touch a trigga is when you fucked Trey Songz
Coke head, you cheated on your man with Ebro
I might leak the footage of you sniffin' them ski slopes
They gassin' you up, but you been on E, though
"Pills and Potions," yep, you been on E, ho
Got your ghostwriters back, so you think you lit
Rem Belushi, I'm a Ghostbuster, bitch
I'm supposed to be scared
'Cause you bought your Barbie chain back?
I'll revert to "Ante Up," you'll get your Barbie chain yapped
Tried to front in February, catch you in that Maybach
Show you how to use your name, you be usin' your name wack
I'm sayin', how you mix Nicki with a Minaj?
I'ma park this bitch, put Nicki in the garage
I'm gettin' money like Nicky Barnes, I'm the big homie
I responded in less than 48 Hours; Nick Nolte
Gettin' close like Nick Jonas, grippin' the gauge
Then blaze off, Face Off, bitch, Nicolas Cage
You animated like Nickelodeon, you fake, bitch
Only the kids believe in you; you St. Nick
Now when I shoot Nick at Nite, they won't understand it
I'm Wild'n Out, 'bout to hit Nick with the Cannon
How are you on the VMAs, actin' like you hood?
Way across the stage, talkin' about "Miley, what's good?"
That's Hannah Montana, she was always happy
You only fronted on Mariah 'cause Mariah don't carry
Tried to disrespect Taylor 'cause Taylor wasn't Swift enough
Pillsbury Doughgirl; Remy pick the biscuit up
I'm jealous? Bitch, you was happy when they took me
Best thing that ever happened to you was when they booked me
You said you never fucked Wayne – how stupid I look, B?
Get the picture, I'll expose you, I'm kind of a bully
You named yourself Nicki Lewinsky, the mind of a rookie
'Cause you was suckin' his dick and now he tired of your nookie
You claimed you never fucked Drake
Now that's where you took me
You fucked the whole Empire – who you tryin' to be, Cookie?
Boogie Down Bronx, I come out of the Boogie
To let you know real bitches never lie on their pussy
And stop talkin' numbers, you signed a 360 deal
Through Young Money, through Cash Money, through Republic
Which means your money go through five niggas before you touch it
Any videos, promotions come out of your budget
Endorsements, tour and merchandise, they finger-fuck it
You make, like, 35 cents off of each ducat
I own my masters, bitch, independent
So for every sale I do, you gotta do like ten
Stop comparin' yourself to Jay, you not like him
You a motherfuckin' worker, not a boss like Rem
You're done, them pop chicks ain't get the news yet
Bitch, I pop chicks, yeah, and I'm the new vet
I kill rappers, and you good as dead, bitch
Talkin' shit about me to a deaf bitch
And usually I have sympathy for the impaired
But not when you hard of hearin' from untreated gonorrhea
But you point your fingers at me? I’m the bad girl
When she the one out here misleadin' the black girls?
All these fake-asses influenced by that girl
Dyin' from botched surgeries – what a sad world!
But before the butt job, you was a Spongebob
Suckin' cock for records, captain of the cum squad
And I got a few words for the moms of the young Barbz
Guess who supports a child molester? Nicki Minaj
You paid for your brother’s wedding? That’s hella foul
How you spendin' money to support a pedophile?
He a walkin' dead man, sendin' threats to him
I guess that’s why they call you Barbie, you was next to Ken
Talkin’ about your money long and your foreign sick
Why you ain’t help your bro hide his cum from forensics?
You probably somewhere overseas, foreign sick
Thought you could fuck with me, by far Rem sick
Meek, Drake, Safaree, I see men in your pants
We call that Jelani, get it? Semen in your pants
Uh, I got trigger fingers, you got bitter fingers
Yeah, you must think you Drake and I'm Twitter fingers
VH1, watch this
You just got bodied by a Love & Hip-Hop bitch

[Outro]
Don't ever in your fuckin' life play with me
That's on the set!
You tried it on the Rae Sremmurd record
You tried it on your little freestyle
They was both duds, just like every other one was duds
Just like this last one was a dud
But what you not gonna do is keep subbin' me
Big… Pun!
I send a fuckin' headshot, you dead, bitch!
Will not lose!

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man

[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

[Intro: XXXTENTACION & Nicole Dollanganger]
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I hailed the ground you walk on
Yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

Don't try stopping me

No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

[Verse 2]
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

[Outro: Darlene Tibbs]
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king

At a Clippers game on the courtside (Side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five (Five)
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger"
(Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (Nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some
Girl, say some, no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]

Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'ma ball, King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

Are all alone, no no, no no no no no (All she needed was some)

Je suis à 91 mille lieues sous la merde
J'ai mille eu' sous la semelle (ouais, ouais, ouais)
J'ai mêmes soucis en fin de semaine (en fin de semaine)
J'ai paire de couilles en cas de problème
Le monde, j'le vois de travers, je le monte (je le monte en l'air)
En l'air, en l'air jusqu'à (jusqu'à) ce que ce putain de bonheur se montre (bah ouais)
Y'a pas de cinéma j'ai pas de temps, pas de temps à donner ou à perdre
Baba m'a dit faut du douze, faut scier l'canon pour la guerre (eh, eh, eh)
Et la guerre et la guerre on l'a fait, on la refera, pourquoi donc épiloguer (pourquoi donc épiloguer)
Pas de paix, pas de paix, pas de paix dans le contrat, la haine pour co-piloter
Il s'agit de n'plus jouer au con (nan), dans l'regard paraît qu'on y voit une âme (Ah bon ?)
Chez moi on dit qu'au fond du trou (quoi ?), jette un homme il ressort avec une arme
Pardonnez-moi, poussez-vous, là-bas, vite fait, deux secondes
Parce que sinon c'est ma bite dans votre cul qui vous flaire, qui vous sert de sonde
J'aime voir le ciel, j'aime ce silence alors ferme ta gueule (ta gueule)
J'perds pas le Nord, nan j'ai l'courage qui emmerde ma peur
La feuille est si belle, plus j'écris plus j'salis
Fleur de décibels, ma rage les contamine (les contamine)
Un million par mois et là j'ai l'bon timing (eh, eh)
Sous alcool, sous beuh (hum), j'ai tout fait consciemment
Le poids d'mes erreurs (hum), découpé constamment (hum ouais)
Un regard, un mytho, un sourire
Et le cœur qui n'veut plus se nourrir
Des minutes, des années sur la montre
Naïveté ou trahison sur un mot

[Couplet 2 : N.O.S]
Igo la vie est moche donc on l'a maquillée avec des mensonges
Igo son âme est moche, plus qu'à la maquiller avec des mensonges
J'sais pas c'qu'il s'passe dans ma tête
Parfois, j'voudrais sauver la Terre
Parfois, j'voudrais la voir brûler
Ça va pas trop, j'roule un teh
Trop d'haine pour neuf mètres carrés
Tristesse faut pas calculer
J'aime pas tes rêves, cauchemars entassés
Le cœur qui brûle, sentiments glacés
On s'connaît pas, j'aime pas ton passé
La mif' va bien, pas s'embarrasser
Parfois peur de demain, peur de t'ôter la vie
Parce qu'on a grandi et ma haine aussi (haine)
Chérie t'as le boule qui bat, un peu de tendresse j'dis pas
Non car j'ai le cœur qui bat après quatre, cinq barres
J'sais pas si le bonheur va m'endurcir, dur dans la merde
J'sais pas si son cœur va me suffire, j'rajoute la mer
J'regarde le ciel, j'attends l'orage
J'attends la nuit, j'attends mon cash
J'me vide dans le cul du superficiel
J'recharge mon arme j'ai le cœur qui saigne
Les sentiments, ta chatte : éphémère
J'ai le cœur qui bande devant billets verts
J'croise les même cafards dans le même bât'
J'ai les même plats pour les mêmes pâtes
Il y a moins de stress à six du mat'
Et je veux plus jamais voir l'impasse
Je l'ai mise à nu, elle m'a volé mon cœur
Confiance, confiance, plus de mal que de peur
Garde tout dedans, plus de larmes que de pleurs
Garde tout dedans, plus de larmes que de pleurs
J'ai pas le temps de te séduire, faut que j'retourne charbonner
J'ai pas le temps de te mentir, QLF abonné
Cette lumière va partir et mes rêves en pâtir
Cette lumière va partir, l'obscurité m'attire
La manière dont tu comptes en dit long sur ce que t'as brassé
La manière dont tu pompes en dit long sur ce que t'as sucé
Tends pas ta main, on te tord ton âme
Et le shit a bullé jusqu'au dernier gramme

[Outro : Ademo]
J'suis pas net, pas net, sah
Pute de planète j'fais du sale
Je vois leur regard me dire à l'aide
Et plus je monte, plus j'ai mal
J'suis pas net, pas net, sah
Pute de planète j'fais du sale
Je vois leur regard me dire à l'aide
Et plus je monte, plus j'ai mal

Put 'em on time out, and never call, these niggas
Pussy like girls; damn, is my pussy gay?
It's a holiday: Play-With-My-Pussy Day

Pussy ride dick, like she a Jamaican
Pussy stay warm, pussy on vacation
You loose bitches, need a pussy renovation
You could eat it, with a pussy reservation
Pussy 'bout to get, a standin' ovation
Clap, clap-clap for this pussy, nigga
But I can't give this pussy, to a pussy nigga
Aw man, slow down
I'ma get you something that you could hold down
But I can't give you head, I'm too ill for that
I'ma  make a movie still, Kill Bill for that
Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga? Custom done!?
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot? Bust me down!?
You the same clown nigga, that was runnin' me down!?
Now you all up in the sauce, cause you wanna be down!?
I said, "Rule Number 1: To Be A Boss-Ass Bitch"
Never let a clown nigga, try to play you
If he play you, then "Rule number 2:  -
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em 'yes' men"
And get a dick pic, and then you press "Send"
And send a red heart, and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends, love how your pussy taste
And that's rule 3: I'm the school T
My wrist look like, I am a jewel thief
But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese, and grill my swordfish

If he catch my drift, he could catch my jizz

Looked down at it, and I said, "This is big!"
Man, my game so cold I said, "This is rigged"
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell 'em bitches, cross their T's and dot their I
I-I-I-I-I-I- I came back, bitches' flows still boring
I said, "Damn, man, go back to whoring"
You know I still lead the league, in scoring -
You know I'm still bad, and I'm still foreign
I'ma give bitches, time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York, Knickerbock
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot, OH -
But on the real, I'm in album mode
I just dropped this freestyle, 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound

When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
Cause I'm comin' for you
Ooh, ooh...

Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I go rich bitch off
Cause you know my style gettin' bit, ripped-off
When I'm at the restaurant: rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, I got a rich bitch cough

Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 1]
Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, ayy, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light? Yeah
I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "You took the summer off? We couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it, somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it, ah!

[Chorus]
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 2]
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these women
They don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season women fuckin' off-season niggas
To get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

[Beat Switch]

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me

On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', man ain't no tellin'

[Verse 3]
I gotta keep watchin' for oppers
'Cause anything's possible, yeah
There's no code of ethics out here
Anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got
Let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta
Then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle, how much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her
To get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please do not speak to me
Like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears
I go huntin', put heads on my fire place, oh my

It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[JEFFERSON]
Ev’ry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin’ for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

[JEFFERSON AND BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

Look back at the Bill of Rights

[MADISON]
Which I wrote

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
The ink hasn’t dried
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[MADISON]
So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size?

[BURR]
Look in his eyes!

[JEFFERSON]
See how he lies

[MADISON]
Follow the scent of his enterprise

[JEFFERSON]
Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive

[MADISON]
If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it

[JEFFERSON]
I have to resign

[MADISON]
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

[BURR]
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

[JEFFERSON]
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse

[MADISON AND JEFFERSON]
You can’t put it out from inside the house

[JEFFERSON]
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out!

[MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON]
Oh!
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose
Oh!
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes
Oh!
Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up against!
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Southern motherfuckin’—

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Democratic-Republicans!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Because every second the Treasury grows

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton’s misdeeds

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
It must be nice. It must be nice

[MADISON]
Follow the money and see where it goes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
It must be nice. It must be nice

[JEFFERSON]
The emperor has no clothes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
We won’t be invisible. We won’t be denied
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[Intro: AZ and Nas]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

[Intro]
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)

[Interlude]
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!

[Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

[Break]
Slave for the—
Said, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Been a slave for ya
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

I'm a slave for ya Nikki
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya

Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

So no, I don't want your number (Uh, uh)
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere (No, no)
No, I don't want none of your time and (Uh)

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Whoo)
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride

Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass (Yeah)

So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and (Said no)

Trying to holla at me

A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, love
No scrub, love

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me

I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down

Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience ‘cause—

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward."
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are."
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no
Sometimes I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo (Slow motion)
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro

If we ain't love the same bitch

Only problem is I'm rich
Uh, 21 Grammys, superstar family
We the new Jacksons, I'm all about that action
I'm about that Farrakhan, life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm, I'ma turn up every time
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really gettin' it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas: impregnate Bridget
So when she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the Fruit of Islam in the trenches hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walkin', livin', breathin' god, you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back, heh?
What you want?
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack, heh, huh?
Uh, I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
I need to know right now if you a freak or not

I wanna know right now if you a freak or not

Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoes
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gone fall out 'bout hoes

I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
.40's, on .40's, on .40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil nigga, but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy

Vintage frames, I see nobody fuckin' wit' him

Sir acts just like his dad, shit is trippy (uh-huh)
Twinning, Blue and Rumi, me and Solo how fitting

Yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried
Yo, chill man! We keepin' it real with these people, right?
Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight)
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather (uhh)
Move the whole family West, but it's whatever
In a glass house still throwing stones
Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
Just hood ass niggas in designer suits (ooh)
Follow my moves on a truth in Alaïa boots, yeah, yeah
Amelia Earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
Fake news y'all choose, we no lie
No photoshop, just real life
(Happy in love)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Damn, look at us now
Pray, pray for the vows
Way up now, it's a long way, a long way down
We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all
We came, and we conquered, now we're happy in love
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)

Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)

Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, best not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love but want to really burn me

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Lions don't lose sleep over the 'pinion of sheep
On the road to the riches, money sticking to my cleats
I am moi, magnifique, skin noir, Darky Meech
Niggas with the most opinions usually have the least
It's funny how now rappers be on their druggy shit
Downloaded my tape, sat back, studied shit
Acid pack a hundred hits, shroom caps and hash bricks
Trippy like that Destiny Child chick on 106
This white bitch had the fucking nerve to call me a nigga
When she the one paying the surgeon for her lips to get bigger
Do you get the bigger picture? Shit is backwards, my nigga
You sneak dissing, taking jabs, get your boxing on
Cause you ain't get the word, I'm Glock Lesnar in the octagon
This shit is straight absurd, do not hate me cause your life is shitty
I show no pity, you turd, you better off in the dirt
Now you better off dead, like the title of my work

So much grams, unzip the bag

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Every day; me and Mary Jane
You might say I'm addicted, but me, I'm truly lifted
Stoned so loud, you can hear me in the crowd
Smoking girl scout, sour by the ounce
Mary never cheat me
Mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll lie and deceive me
Spread it even, even, hash wax in the evening
Dab or die trying, on the road to Zion
Damn, they try and stick me for my paper
They trying to take me under, I've seen it through the vapors
Jealous ones still envy, got a couple real with me
And my bitch will talk some shit and smoke the kil' with me
Meech will hide the body, enough of that though
They saying talk is cheap, so I'll be smiling when we meet
They screaming "Zombies!" out in England
But I'm on the block with Mary, pushing and dreaming
Ah ah ah, I'm feeling myself
Thizzle, fo' shizzle, my nizzle, spitting riddles on instrumentals
Trippy life, blotter in the night
Fill my appetite (Fill my appetite)

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
Could be your mans, or be your fan, or be your kin
Pay your dues, man, I gotta choose, whether I lose or win this
Foe or friend, can't determine the difference
The instance they see you peaking, they pussy be leaking fluid
My nigga, what is you doing, all black in the back of a Buick
I'm proving I'm sadistic as sin, as I'm making murderous music
We don't rep the same things, nah, don't bother confuse it
So much stressing on my brain, momma think I'ma lose it
Human vagabond, hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
Why you hating niggas acting nonchalant (Honest, brah)
Fuck your publication that say I'm a third wheel
Architect build your mind, set stress but won't swell
Oh yes, I smoke kill, I'm crack, you smoke krills
I pack, you dope deal, in fact, I'm so chill
I'm never off the pivot, six stitches to your image
Not offended when you call me genius, all that means is

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me

But it's cool, know you heard it all before

Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—


Start of song 


Part I: Stay Ready

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreaming
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You've probably been waiting forever
So how does it sound:
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]
Come to me, come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now
All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

Part II: What a Life

All that I know is right now
Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what you're given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doin' like
Whatever gets me through the night
What a life
I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control

[Hook 2: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
They say
The truth ain't pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
And you know plenty
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' bout
'Cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty
If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life that I've been given
What a life
What a life that I've been living
What a life
What a life we die to live in
What a life

Start of song 


[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say "hello"
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook: Master Gee]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

[Bridge: Intro sound: 16 measures]

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said "damn fly guy I'm in love with you"
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said "I go by the name of Lois Lane"
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says "momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull"
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says "man there's plenty of food"
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says "I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends"

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike]
I say "Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo"
I said "come on, make uh, make the people move"

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said "sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme"
So from six to six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Outro: Master Gee]
.....The east to the west, I rock you the best....

They say, "Lil Nahmir where you been at?" I'm just passin' a breeze
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on me
I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be acting like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin C's like they crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil Corey and Lil Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch I keep a 40
You say I'm lackin', nigga try me, shoot you and yo' shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
40 poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil Valley, he get slumped nigga
We shoot his body then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil Quay, well then that nigga gotta go
I'm really small but I can fight but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me, ho
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life, that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near yo' head, well I'ma fuckin get it, man

[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)

I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!

Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Intro]
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella
Bella, Bella

[Refrain]
Elle répondait au nom de "Bella"
Les gens du coin ne voulaient pas la cher-lâ
Elle faisait trembler tous les villages
Les gens me disaient : "Méfie-toi d'cette fille-là"
Elle répondait au nom de "Bella"
Les gens du coin ne voulaient pas la cher-lâ
Elle faisait trembler tous les villages
Les gens me disaient : "Méfie-toi d'cette fille-là"

[Couplet 1]
C'était un phénomène, elle n'était pas humaine
Le genre de femme qui change le plus grand délinquant en gentleman
Une beauté sans pareille, tout le monde veut s'en emparer
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau
Hypnotisés, on pouvait tout donner
Elle n'avait qu'à demander, puis aussitôt on démarrait
On cherchait à l'impressionner, à devenir son préféré
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau
Mais quand je la vois danser le soir
J'aimerais devenir la chaise sur laquelle elle s’assoit
Ou moins que ça, un moins que rien
Juste une pierre sur son chemin

[Couplet 2]
Oui, c'est un phénomène qui aime hanter nos rêves
Cette femme était nommée "Bella la peau dorée"
Les femmes la haïssaient, toutes la jalousaient
Mais les hommes ne pouvaient que l'aimer
Elle n'était pas d'ici, ni facile, ni difficile
Synonyme de "magnifique", à ses pieds : que des disciples
Qui devenaient vite indécis, tremblants comme des feuilles
Elle te caressait sans même te toucher
Mais quand je la vois danser le soir
J'aimerais devenir la chaise sur laquelle elle s’assoit
Ou moins que ça, un moins que rien
Juste une pierre sur son chemin

[Refrain]
Elle répondait au nom de "Bella"

Allez, fais-moi tourner la tête, hé hé

(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me) How you doin'?
(Call me) My name is Lonely, nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me, woo!

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me)
911, call me some time
(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Fuck I need gold for man?)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Fuck I need clothes for man?)

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky & Fetty Wap]
The rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on 'em
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed (No)
Those margaritas not goin' on my card (No)
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L the Jew biz major? (Ayy)
Fuck you know about the world he raised in? (Fuck)
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker 13
I wear the same pair of jeans every day (It's true)
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away (It's true)
Book flight December but I leave in May (I do)
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks, Greg!

Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)

What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
All of my luggage is Louis V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregardin' them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil' nigga somethin' like a preacher
I can take his ass to church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I could...

[Interlude: Lil Dicky]
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
Trap, trap, trap
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie (Please)
Hair cut several months in-between, homie (Always)
Hit the mafuckin' lights when I leave, homie (YOLO)
Single ply TP, ass bleed
Airbnb the motherfuckin' lease, I'm never there
I'm out in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
At happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
And that applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees, phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it (All the fam)
401K, rollin' over bands on it (Ayy)
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on 'em (I'm hot)
The fuck you rappers bragging 'bout? You overpaying for it

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the clothes at, baby? (Yeah baby)
Ayy, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I'm judicious)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I'm cost-efficient)
Ayy, we gon' save that money (Yeah, I do it different)
What we do? We gon' save that money

[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover (Never)
Low thread count, hard with the covers (Woo)
Free trial memberships, though
I never join the shiz though (Ayy)
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch though (Brr)
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite a bit
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans though (Ayy)
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands, though (Ayy)
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo (Ayy)
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke (Ayy)
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
My dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me, well I fuckin' don't!

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, where the gold at, baby? (Yeah baby)

Every time these niggas tryna play
And lately, I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up 'cause all about the bands, baby
800K underneath the bed baby, ayy

[Outro: Lil Dicky]
If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem, sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be (Brr)
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I get to bustin' like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him purty hot (Uh)
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Nina's a dirty chopper (Uh)
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though?
I said to Seven, "Richie Havens'll be the man"
So we put it together thinkin' Eminem was a gamble (uh)
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "What we doin'?" – I said to him, "Let's chop!"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked (Uh)
Never be another chopper's comin' so let's rock, nigga! (Uh)
You're on, people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer makin' a tour strong
If you thinkin' of battlin'—uh, you're gone!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Nobody can catch him, he the Speedy Gonzales
The beat is a problem
And if you got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em, and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
This is it, man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And if fans will lift hands, we'll get dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands up movin' the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
I beat 'em, I burn 'em (Then I let 'em melt)
They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up (Uh)
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton, make 'em be impotent
If and when I be flippin', niggas be feminine (Okay)
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast, or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half-ass deliverin' I'ma eat your dinner (Yum)
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys (Okay)
I jump around, so do that mean that I'm rubberized? (Okay)
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We'll bleed 'em, beat 'em 'til they be gone, feed 'em!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

Like I'll never slow down

Sometimes (go) I feel (go)
Like I'll never slow down

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills
Of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
Or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in Vics
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after tonight
I'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent-up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver
Screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
I went through the window
And ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yellin' dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
Of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity that I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
To make 'em picket, I pick a day to be a prick
Then I'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible
Head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away? Uh-uh, not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake, eatin' lobster, steak
And coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye walkin' up on the stage
For Beyoncé, like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
In a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

Sometimes (go) I feel (go)
Like I'll never slow down
(Worldwide Choppers)
Sometimes (go) I feel (go)
Like I'll never slow down
(Worldwide Choppers)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's havin' to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we givin' the light, a lot of energy
We reppin', beat checkin' he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Running you down, in front of your town
You ever makin' fun of the clown, I'm gunnin' you down
We doin' it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, no one'll be found, bitch!
Would never be choppin' without Slick Rick
I got it from the record "Lick the Balls" and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, 'cause every time I be droppin' I get bit
I'm hearin' a lot of rappers, they tryin' to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em and we kill 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista rule it—and this it

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)
Speedom! (If you wanna go with us)
Speedom! (I'ma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom! (I must be the one to bust)
Speedom! (And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

[Post-Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Sometimes (go) I feel (go)
Like I'll never slow down

Sometimes (go) I feel (go)
Like I'll never slow down

[Skit: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say "Only God can judge me," ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

Mike WiLL Made-It, nigga

Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I see these silly nigga’s flexin', it’s a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said "Oooh shit!"
Picked up my phone cause I had to call "Bullshit!"
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin'  all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'ma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'ma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

Get my people out them chains, nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin', bruh?
'Cause I'm a black man in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her till the springs break

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
In my four-door, lookin' real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money gettin' long, pussy rate keep risin'
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Sellin' that chicken; no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm gettin' so much money I can buy your bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women workin' naked
Fell in love with a waitress—what the fuck I'm thinkin'?
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin', that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

[Verse 2: Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for? Got a black card and a black Phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie

I'm 'bout to rumble in the jungle in these new Kanye's
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!

[Verse 3: Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for, 'cause my belt got two G's on it?
Her bag got two C's on it? My daughter's stroller got D's on it?
Free Big Meech, free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef, nigga; no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got coke swimmin' in that glass jar, bitch, go turn on them burners!
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga; no female, I smack niggas; Sprewell
I'm on the block like D12, I got the white; no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born totin' that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith and no Nona Gaye
But they yellin'…

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!

I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran; I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel
Now you swimmin' in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settlin' for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothin' at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not taggin' along

Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashin' the chrome
I'm wavin' the TEC, Tity sprayin' the MAC
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
I got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sittin' in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at LAX
Speakin' skateboards, where Tune at? Fuck with him
I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back, 2 Chainz!

[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, "No Lie" already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence. If you got work
Go to work, don't work at your residence

Swimmin' through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the mothafuckas in, made another mil
Got a nigga feelin' like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it, whip his ass today

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

"Yes, you've reached Thick Niggas Incorporated, how may I direct your call?"

[Verse]
Anime bitches, I look at her titties
Then I take her home and we count up these fifties
I come to your city, I sneak in yo' chimney
I tickle her kidney and then I watch Disney
I love me some hentai, I go on Xvideos
Bitch, I'm Dbangz, stick my dick in your Cheerios
Bitch, I'm Dbangz, I might fuck my computer
I whip out my dick, then pull up on my shooter
I tickle your booty and then I get neutered
I know I'm a loser, I tickle your tumor
I find me a bitch that got no sense of humor
It's Lil Cumstain, I'm the booty consumer
I take off her shoe and then do the maneuver
And if she act tough, I might whip out the Luger
You know I'm with Kia, I go to IKEA
She soft like a cheetah, she from Costa Rica
Hey, lil' mama, come through, get respected
She take off her shoe, I take out my erection
I suck on her middle toe, don't use protection
K call me, "Papi," I teach her a lesson
I only eat ass, it's a pussy oppression
You swear that she loyal, your bitch in my mentions
I whip out my dick, paint her face like Picasso
I suck on her toes, then I'm out like El Chapo
I look at her booty hole, eat it like tacos
I respect on women, she better not swallow
She touch on my cockpit, I put it on auto
"Suck toes and eat ass!," that's the DBongo motto
I cuff me a Kia, then write her a song
She take off her shoe and I take off that thong
I whip out my dick, she said, "Baby, what's wrong?"
"Girl, nothing, I'm 'bout to smash like I'm King Kong"
"Papi, go harder," I nutted a while back
Bitch, I'm Dbangz, I ball hard like the Wildcats
She talking 'bout Troy, she take out her toy
'Cause my dick was too small for her to enjoy
I meet with the mom, yeah, Kia so bomb
I whip out my weenie on PornHub.com

You lie on pussy, that's weak shit
We pass pussy 'round, that's G shit
But you ain't fam so what is this "we" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said

Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
G’s dope, he might blow up, think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

Outside in an all black ride, tint rolled up when I'm high
Said they all wanna live, but I just wanna die
Motherfucker, if you're looking for me, find me in the night
I got a knife, don't wanna fight
I wanna take your fucking life, and end it right on sight
When I strike, if you bark, better bite
Block hot, fuck the cops, pop a six-shot Glock
Then I trot to the rocks, with me own blood clot
Red-dot, bodies drop when I cock, then I spot
No tomb, no plot, throw 'em off of the yacht, undocked
With the slot of the skull hangin' in the fucking river, ho
$ui-$uicide, 6-6-6, *59, so cynical

[Verse 2: Yung Plague]
Got a pound in the blunt, I'm loungin'
Pour another round, I'm drownin'
Climb to the top, I will jump off the mountain, ayy
Swerve, swervin' in a motherfucking all-white Crown Vic'
Blue light mounted, siren howlin'
Stole it from a cop because he popped another brown kid (Ayy)
Got the town lit up by the flame that I made
From my grey serenade, make way for the Plague
On the seventh day, grey bodies lay in they graves
Still got the badge, still got the gun
Still got the patch, still got the stun
Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun
Put the Glock to my skull then I—

[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, $outh $ide $uicide, kill yourself, ho
Say you gettin' money, but your numbers don't show, you a liar
Baseball bat fully wrapped in barbed wire
For anyone that's tryna get by us (Bitch)
I been thinkin' a lot, I see these rappers tryna get at my spot
Robb told me you gotta get it how you live
Told that bitch, "You better get up out my biz"
Pickle-breath-ass ho with a face like thizz (Shut the fuck up)
You don't want no issue with
Nose seen more blow than most nose seen a tissue
I got anxiety so I can't really do an interview
Don't come close to me
I'm not the one to really do it how it's 'posed to be
Independent, tell the label to get over me
I'm over here with my peers, gettin' rich point blank
Before I bring her to the crew make sure that bitch don't stink
Ain't no rules to the game, talk how you want (Yuh)
Walk how you want (Yuh), my job is the shit
I used to clean up shit from the rim of the toilet
Now I'm gettin' money, I don't gotta pack a pistola
Okay, maybe (Maybe), 'cause jealousy make a man go crazy
Money make a motherfucker hate me
One thousand bitches, they all wanna date me

Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got they canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious, fat, fabulous, fantastic
Flurries of funk felt, feeding the fanatics
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in this game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns, hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice, naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quannnum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got, uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish
While I'm all well would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back, yak mouth, young ones' yaws
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
Zero in, Zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme
Zealots!

Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

[Verse 2]
Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (Uh)
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (Okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (Okay)
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch," dick up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (Okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (Okay)
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try

[Chorus]
Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

[Bridge]
They would still wife me
They would still wife me
Yup, him too, he would still wife me
Ahh, ha

[Verse 3]
When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence
When it's clear they bite me, I'm flattered they like me
I don't wanna check bitches, tell 'em wear their Nikes
Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings
That's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz
Uh, Barbie white picket Barbie fence
All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in

Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you

Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

[Intro]
It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

[Verse]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
"Never get high on your own supply"
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em "bounce!"
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called "consignment"
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"
Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jacob
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
‘Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas going crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Hook: Both & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a

Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah!)
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told ya I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m 'bout to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never going to jail

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermès of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showing off
I'm done, I'll hit you up maña...nah!

Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
Viva México, cubano

Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can’t you see we gettin' money up under you?

Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read: "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chillin' (Uh), Ye is chillin' (Uh)
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

I hustle the first to the first

These bitches be naggin' the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

[Chorus: Future]
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger

[Verse 2: Drake]
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I

I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Verse 2]
Yo
People'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills 'n' potions
We're overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Bridge]
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time, we'll be fine
In due time

[Chorus]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like "Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly"
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
"I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life"
Air Maxes were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the thread, at school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me "Be a consumer"
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There’s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh

Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Boy, you's a fool, D-R

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Pre-Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

[Outro]
Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)

Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)

Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

I wanna hit line drives…
Wanna lose weight and keep eating…
For you…
Hey, whats up doc?

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Gunplay]
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)

That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!)

Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit

Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)

Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain…

I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go

Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

First thing you say: I'm not fazed

Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Let's get lost
Let's get lost

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I'm in so deep, girl, probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (Igh), damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh, your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you
If he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-oh, you been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'ma fix you, I'ma fuck you, I'ma get rid of them demons

Damn, I need a minute, aight, leggo
She fell in love, it fell apart, aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah, me mad petty, yeah, me bogus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me know
Yeah, she knew too (Igh), it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like, "Fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 3: Noname]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "Pill pop, baby girl, 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek
The masochism that you preach
Practice backflips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Igh

So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me

‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie.

Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to.

Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city...

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say "He died so young"
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay

Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy

[Verse 1: Future]
Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

I just want to take you out and show you off

Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it

I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I came out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city

I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mayor comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth

And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes

Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you

Iced out teeth on an iced out whip

Always wanna fuck, tell a bitch, "Good luck"
Always wanna fuck 'cause I just came up, yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Yeah, gotta love it

Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

[Chorus]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

[Verse 2]
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye

I'm addied up, add it up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
’Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the Fall
Then it's time for me to fly out
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, he can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

Baby girl, you know what I like

[Verse 3]
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy who
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all over now
Shout my nigga Stixx, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

[Outro]
All of them swallow

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale, ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

[Chorus: Kanye West]
But I still drove 30 hours
And I, I still drove 30 hours to you, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I drove back 30 hours

Better on sighting
For astern, oh

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws

Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

Pull up in a Demon, on God (On God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (Fraud)

[Intro: Yesi Ortiz]
Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits til' I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

[Hook 1: Lloyd & Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh

[Post-Hook: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

[Hook 2: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playin' "Strange Fruit"
If I'ma make it to a billi, I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'

I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet
Y'all know it's one of one
Soon as you hear that, "uh-uh", uh (Right)
Y'all know the difference right?
From rap facts and fiction, right? Shit
Real life I'm like HOV, real life I'm life goals
In real life they're like me? In real life I'm like, "No."
My swag different (Mm), that bag different (Uh-huh)
My wife Beyoncé (Yeah), I brag different (Uh)
My baby Blue (What else?)
I dream in color (What else?)
That's too much flavor (What else?)
I don't rap to suckas (Ha!)
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
I only talk special cloth
Said I only talk special, ah!

"Yeah, Gangsta Dresta done stepped in this, motherfucker. And this one goes out to all the O.G.'s out there. And I can't forget the baby gangstas, what's up, niggas? My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all on his dick in the first place, yeah. So run that shit, E, yeah."

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said, "My man JD is on freebase"
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car trying to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck-head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know, I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops, knocked his ol' ass out

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now I'm rolling hard, now under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh, brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walking home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 5: Eazy-E]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out, "Fire," then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl, but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Verse 1]
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, God)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, "Woo!"
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!

[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

[Verse 2]
I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!

[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Intro: Wale & Miguel]
I'ma rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real
Hol' up
Lotus flower bomb firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flowerbomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby, you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you Mine

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Bridge: Miguel]
'Cause I don’t know you, you don’t know me
The clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be
I don’t know you, you don’t know me
Let me teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "wine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."

And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

The blessings come down, Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
(Good God)

[Chorus: Jamila Woods, Byron Cage & (Chance The Rapper)]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?

Bodies in fluoride, let the rope untie, just crucify me
Yung Christ wrists sliced, couple hoes on ice, singing "R.I.P!"

Ruby was a motherfucking reject
Then I cut my wrists, and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke
After all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost
Tell 'em, "No, I just seep smoke when the weed's blown"
She chokes from the deep-throat, three feet of rope, lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep, so evil
I'ma hang myself, and then I get to see home
Ruby a fucking demon, ayy, uh
Ruby got a cult now, hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon, I'm evolved now
Loud growl, $now Leopard on the prowl, ayy

Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, "I know you need a break."
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him

I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music" so I woke up with my wood hard

He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

Maybe I'm just a fool

No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me

[Chorus]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Verse 2]
Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by Gawd Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (One up)

Cheatin' on your man but you can get it if you want it
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga takin' shots, send 'em back, check the postage, yeah
Hatin' ass nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up

Every nigga did you wrong, except for me
I'm next to blow and so you should've been next to me
Say you lovesick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no
(Boy, if you don't get!)

I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business (Uno)
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth

And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay

Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

I just text yo phone like 30 sometimes in a row
You ain't gotta lie 'cause it's going on 5
And if you ain't in my bed then you laying with a ho
So fuck that love shit
I don't feel none of that
Like I'm numb to the pain, said I'm done with the game, but I'm still here running back
'Cause I already know your lingo
You talk to these hoes like you're single
You know you really love pulling fast ones
Cheat, come home and act dumb
Pussy nigga, pussy nigga, listen nigga
I see shit even when you ain't in sight
I just hold it in like it's picture time
I've been holding back for a long while
Just hoping soon it'll turn around but
How can I word this?
You ain't been perfectt
Tell me you working late
Your phone losing service
And now I'm here thinking like "This nigga tweakin"
You sorry, pathetic and far from authentic
You liar, you fronter, you just like these other, niggas
As much as I hate you, I still wanna date you
You better just hope I don't

Sick of this keep it on the DL shit
You say you with the bros when you out with a bitch
You say you at the crib when you leaving her place
I pull up to ya crib and you lie to my face
He like "Baby, you my all and all
I was in the bathroom when I missed ya call"
Nah, you was in the backseat sweating like an athlete
Doing everything that you said you wouldn't
But I ain't gon' trip on a weak ass nigga
I'ma just find me a nigga much bigger
I'ma just do the same shit that you do when I'm not up in the room
Yeah, baby, let's think
I'ma text Bryan, Facetime Ryan
Call up Keenan, tell 'em I need him
Niggas ain't loyal, and I knew from the jump
When you showed me the ropes that I wouldn't never have trust for you
You creepin, I'm leavin, you call me, I pick up, I hang up
You text me, "Let's link up"
Then I just say fuck it, then we end up fucking
And you start up something I said I was done with
Then it all repeats in the next 2 weeks
I'll be back on the same "I'm done" shit
If they only knew that I'd rather be loose
Man I'm tempted but I ain't gon'

Plenty secrets of you and your world

I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?

I’m here for one night, how far will you go?

Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)

[Intro: Lissie]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 a.m., summer night
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'ma fuck the world
I'ma be on tunes 'til God re-furls
You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk driving, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight

[Post-Chorus: Lissie]
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Wait hold up, back in this mothafuckin' bitch once again
It's the pretty mothafucka with a 40 ounce of brew
My nigga Q and we drunker than a bitch
We getting millis mothafucka, yeah, uh
Nigga, weed and brews, unbelievable
Got a freak or two, in my vehicle
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink
Then we mix it up, call it Pikachu
With a little bit of crack, little bit of dope
Little bit of smoke, little coke, little weed, when they on them (pills)
Little bit of E, little bit of shrooms
Little bit of deuce, what it do, hands on the (wheels)
And I keep the illest, trillest bitches while I'm swagging it
(Crush a bit, little bit) that's my pursuit of happiness

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight

[Post-Chorus: Lissie]
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
If I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
If I fucked her twice, I might change her life
If I change her life, she might hit my weed
We could have a some and we could round it off with three
Her, Mary and me, I'll keep it strictly G
My philosophy upon living right
Nigga weed and brews, and head every night
Hope the pussy nice, cause I'ma fight the bitch
Beat it down and shit, I be clowning with
Black Hippy crew, how swag am I
Be the reason why, she wanna drown my dick
But I soon realized, she was super dry
No paper planes, the Vegas will fly
Don't act surprised, too much Loc inside
Let's get stupid high, to where I can't reply
Love smoking dope, I won't compromise

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
Yeah

[Refrain]
J'me tire, me demande pas pourquoi j'suis parti sans motif
Parfois je sens mon cœur qui s'endurcit
C'est triste à dire mais plus rien n'm'attriste
Laisse-moi partir loin d'ici
Pour garder l'sourire, je me disais qu'y'a pire
Si c'est comme ça, bah fuck la vie d'artiste
Je sais qu'ça fait cliché d'dire qu'on est pris pour cible
Mais j'veux l'dire juste pour la rime

[Pont]
J'me tire dans un endroit où j'serai pas l'suspect
Après j'vais changer d'nom comme Cassius Clay
Un endroit où j'aurai plus besoin d'prendre le mic'
Un endroit où tout l'monde s'en tape de ma life

Je sais qu'ça fait cliché d'dire qu'on est pris pour cible
Mais j'veux l'dire juste pour la rime

[Couplet]
Si j'reste, les gens me fuiront sûrement comme la peste
Vos interviews m'ont donné trop d'maux d'tête
La vérité c'est que j'm'auto-déteste
Faut qu'j'préserve tout c'qu'il me reste
Et tous ces gens qui voudraient prendre mon tél'
Allez leur dire que j'suis pas leur modèle
Merci à ceux qui disent "Meu-gui on t'aime
Malgré ta couleur ébène"

[Outro]
J'suis parti sans mentir, sans me dire
"Qu'est-ce que j'vais devenir ?"
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, Meu-gui
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, vas-y !
Parti sans mentir, sans me dire
"Qu'est ce que j'vais devenir ?"
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, Meu-gui
Stop ! Ne réfléchis plus, vas-y !

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot

Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die

Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...

Can't pick a side, the Gemini

Promise momma not to fear nobody

Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

[Verse 3]
Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-four?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
"Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': "Domino!"
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'

You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate

Nigga tried me so you know I had to pop him
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'

Feu de bois, jeu de voix, suis-moi
Je te veux pas, fuis-moi, je te veux toi
Feu de bois, jeu de trois, un des deux est de moi
Un des trois est de nous, aidez-nous, aidez-moi
Feu de bois, jeu de voix, tu me dois, Dieu te voit
Montre-moi que du doigt ce que t'as fait de moi
Creux de joie, queue de rois, fée des bois
Fais de moi ce qu'on a fait de toi
Sur le toit, sûre de toi, tu t'y crois
C'est déjà ce qu'on a fait de moi
Fais de toi, fais de nous
Prends pas la tête, je n'tiens plus le coup
On bavardait sans dire un mot
Le bruit de mon silence en dit long
Sentiments grandissants figeant l'ego
Prison de mots, absence de compliment
J'suis en attente, en apprentissage, très peu sage
J'ai vu l'âge à la nage, je fuis l'alcoolisme
Sur la blanche page, j'agonise
Mille latences entre c'que je pense et ce que je dis
Ce que j'obtiens et ce que je vise
Soit c'est le père ou bien le fils
Soit la be-her ou bien la tise
Que la nightzer, ouais

[Pré-refrain]
Je sais c'que tu penses de nous
Quand tu dis que tu n'sais plus quoi penser de nous
Je sais c'que tu veux vraiment
Quand tu dis que tu n'sais plus c'que tu veux vraiment
Je sais qu'tu n'as plus le temps
Quand tu dis que tu penses qu'il te faut plus de temps

Baby (olala), baby (olala)

[Couplet 2]
Tu parles de moi, craches dans mon dos
Je parle de toi, crache dans ta bouche
J's'rai toujours un vrai négro
Que t'aies tes règles ou que t'accouches
J'te vois à travers le rideau
Je t'observe quand tu te touches
J'sais pas si c'est toi ou c'est l'eau
J'vois pas quand tu mouilles dans la douche
Fume quand relation s'effrite
Lune, Soleil dans même rayon
Qu'une parole tant que j'écris, brume, gondole dans l'océan
Femmes aux yeux d'hommes sont que des filles
Sentiments plongés dans l'néant
Pluie, averses de ressentis
Mais silence prend les devants
Je t'aime quand je suis dedans
Dehors, je suis plein de mépris
Ta fragilité n'est plus à prouver
Quand tout allait mal et qu'on le savait pas
On passait du temps à essayer d'en passer
À deux pour l'prix d'un, d'un "nous" sans "toi" et "moi"
J'ai brûlé tes lettres dans un feu de bois
Mais j'ai toujours en tête nos jeux de voix
J'ai suivi l'oseille, toi, la fée des bois
J'ai toujours en toi ce que t'as fait de moi
Que la nightzer, ouais

[Pré-refrain]
Je sais c'que tu penses de nous

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

I bet your lil' sister wanna look like me (Lil' bitch)
I bet your lil' brother wanna fuck on me
Hood bitch, good pussy, I ain't average
Um, he can't come around without that cabbage (Nah)
Um, pop a pussy bitch quick, like a bubblegum
I ain't never worry, I just deal with it for fun

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up

[Verse 3: JT]
JT on the track, and you know I'm 'bout my paper
Pussy sweet, pussy tight, so he called it Lifesaver
If your ass a broke nigga, hell nah, I can't date ya
If your ass a rich nigga, I'ma fuck ya 'til you ain't one
If that nigga a scammer, I'm turnin' to a dancer (Yup)
I make it clap like he got the right answer
Sit on it with manners, get it harder than a hammer
He wanna freak, pussy pink, breast cancer
Oh, you like big butts, well I like big bucks
I don't care about your chain, nigga, or your big truck (Nah)
Yeah, I know you gettin' it, but is you spendin' it?
Give a fuck what a nigga got if he ain't givin' it
Ba-badass bitch, bad attitude (Yeah)
Nails done, hair done, ass too (Ow)
Your baby daddy fuckin' me and suckin' me
He don't answer you, bitch, that's because of me (Period)

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up

[Couplet 1 : Ademo]
Bats les couilles d'l'Himalaya
Bats les couilles, j'vise plus l'sommet
Mon cœur fait "ouhlalala"
Crime passionnel que j'commets
Sur ton cœur, j'fais trou d'boulette
J'fais tache de sang sur le pull
J'désire nullement vous connaître
Ni toi, ni ces fils de putes
J'me tire d'ici si j'm'écoute
Sang corse mélangé bougnoule
La Lune, j'aime plus, j'vous la laisse
J'm'endors sous doré, sous gnôle
J'suis ni d'chez moi ni d'chez vous
Elle veut la bise, elle veut qu'j'la baise
J'connais la route, connais l'adresse
J't'encule sur l'continent d'Hadès
Sale comme ta neuch, mèche courte
Forte comme la ppe-f' qu'j'écoule
J'tire la gueule, j'n'écoute
Que mon âme seule, mektoub
J'vis dans un rêve érotique
Où j'parle peu mais j'caresse le monde
J'meurs dans un cauchemar exotique
Où la Terre ressemble à ma tombe

[Pont : Ademo]
Igo, pourquoi toi, tu parles en "igo" ?
Si ça s'tue, ouais, dis-moi qui signe
Pas d'honneur, toi, tu sens d'ici
WAllah, baba m'a dit : "Mon fils, nan, nan
Toi, pas calculer ces pédales
Moi, j'ai donné pendant longtemps
Puis, j'ai perdu mes pétales"

[Refrain : Ademo]
Au DD
J'la passe, la détaille, la pé-cou, la vi-sser, des regrets d'vant ton bébé
J'sors de chez toi, j'reprends ta voiture mal garée puis j'retire ton PV
J'recherche un billet, des affaires, des plans dans la planque, un peu trop peiné
J'fais un bisou à mes cafards dans la cave du six, les pectoraux gainés
Les BACqueux té-ma parce que les ients-cli ne tomberont jamais sur messagerie
Eh, poto, démarre dans la jungle, j'y suis H24, j'y fais des singeries
La rue, j'la dévale à toute allure avec du Gucci comme Mitch
J'me promène dans les beaux quartiers avec le seum qui fait peur aux riches

[Couplet 2 : N.O.S]
Que la famille, personne nous inquiète jusqu'au dernier gramme
Toujours dans mon 9.1 parce que j'suis baisé par Paname
Sans, sans, sans l'bénéf' de la rue, j'aurais jamais niqué le game (game, game, game)
Me sens pas trop humain, un peu comme mes igos habités, yah
Y'a du sang à vider, yah
Au DD, DD, DD, deuxième ne-grai, j'suis effacé, yah
T'as reconnu le cri, igo t'es animal
Mes rêves, j'connais le prix, le canon rend animal
Au DD
Que la famille dans le bât', on te la push taille-dé
Au DD
Pas mélangé, cœur d'étranger, rien n'a changé, yah
C'qui doit arriver va arriver, yah
C'est peut-être mon dernier album
P't-être ma dernière puta
P't-être mon dernier sourire de toi
Dans mon unga, dans mon unga
Pas plus de haine que d'amour, que j'largue entre mes tours
Moins d'humains après minuit, je sors casser mon tour
Sur un nuage de l'Enfer
Viens, on s'casse, mon frère, avant qu'on s'perde

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Oh, oh
Used to you
Through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Used to you
Through with you
Memory, remember you

Off top, run a nigga out his socks
Niggas talk more than bitches
Niggas really be on cock though (Pussy)
Just fucked a ho out in France
Paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz and my Bentley next
Don't play around on my phone ho, gimme sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now
Strap your bullet vest

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
500 50's, 600 hundreds
700 20's, let's get straight to it
800 10's, what's that, 8 bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands
Let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you
So if he steal it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans
Make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat
Secure the bag, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Oh, A bag secure, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit like fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin'
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic (Crazy)
Chop with the laser, get decapitated
Can't smoke, I'm on papers
Hold on, this my Jamaican (Love one)
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, "I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby"

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Hmmmm! Well shit, bro, let me get her then
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban

[Verse 6: Tee Grizzley]
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit (We go)
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped (boop!)
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit

[Verse 8: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason (Oh, for real?)
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?

[Verse 9: Lil Yachty]
Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
Diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration

[Verse 10: Tee Grizzley]
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down
(Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop!)

[Verse 11: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
From the D to the A, put respect on it
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it?
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease
(Lease, nigga)

[Verse 12: Tee Grizzley]
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty
Wraith comin' this summer, I'ma have your bitch drivin'
Bitch!

Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (Yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (Yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (Yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (Hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (Stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (Locked)
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)

Hit the switch up the suicide doors (Damn)
We already know you vanished though (Ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me (Yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (Nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (No)
Take a second if you think about crossin' me

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
An still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo

[Intro]
Yeah (Ooh)
Yeah (Oh)
They let us in the rap game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear they let me in this motherfucking rap game (Mmm, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Got a chick, I call her Lola, she feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja and I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras, I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia, she be acting boujee
Then she came through and topped me off, now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the Mafia, her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no, no

[Chorus / Hook]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I been at this shit for nine years, now they start to call
I'm a DIY pioneer, they trying to get involved
Yippee ki-yay, ahh yeah, 'bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one, yeah
Come correct when you approach me, I can size you up
Taking all the shots like Kobe, almost 81
Guess I got to play the goalie and go and save me some
I'm probably the only one, yeah

[Chorus / Hook]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Who wants my money? I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Papap would be turning in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned

[Chorus / Hook]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro Chorus / Hook]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't foolin' me at all

[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Misused and misled
Bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face
I fuckin' hate that I love you still (Yeah)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah

I get 'em up! (I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (Fuck it, I'm on one)
I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "Fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done

[Intro: The Winans]
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah

[Intro]
I just wanna know how niggas going to jail
Telling on niggas, coming back home and it still being cool
I just wanna know how a nigga on Instagram and Twitter with fifty thousand followers
Ain’t got no money in real life, but still popping, I just wanna know
I wanna know, if a nigga ain’t really putting it in, but acting like he putting it in
Niggas still letting it fly like it’s cool, I really wanna know man
This shit getting different out here it’s getting spooky

[Verse 1: Meek Mill + Quentin Miller]
Now when that shit went down with Chris, you wrote a check
In New Orleans wore my chain to get respect (you a fraud)
So what that tell me? You a pussy and a fed
Say the wrong shit you know the shooters at your neck
I just wanna know, if you ain’t write that running through the six shit
Tell us who the fuck was Quentin running through the six with?
"Running through the six with my woes
Counting money, you know how it goes
All the real live forever, baby
And the fake get exposed"
Niggas writing for you cause you know you never did shit
When I threw that hook out, I was tryin' to catch a big fish
We the type of niggas to tie your mother up
Fuck your sister in the ass and hit your brother up, pussy
You really sweet, I call you buttercup
You fucking dork you changed the style because you studied us
Coming with the same flow
Switching up your lingo
We just want a refund, this ain’t what we paid for
Every time that we come, we get what we came for
Spitting another niggas shit, but you claim you king though?

[Hook]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
How these niggas acting like they trill but really fake
And people acting like it go
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Was it Quentin Miller? Was it Hush or was it Detail where you really got your flow?
(Milli Vanilli that nigga)

[Verse 2]
Money make a fake ass nigga look real again
Money make a sucker that told look trill again
Says a lot about all the people that's feeling him
But I'ma show you bitch ass niggas what's real again
Heard that other nigga talking we ain’t get back yet
Let’s keep it short, nigga you ain’t get your chick back yet
And now she rocking with the chaser and now you missed that check
You went from Clear Port to boarding pass you miss that jet, hold up

[Interlude 1: Sample]
"Cat, I got to take them off of here—that's right—I got to take them off of here, there’s only one, and that’s me, you understand?
'Fore all that fighting, you understand? Sucka thinks he good—sucka thinks he can whoop me, And I know he can’t whoop me and I—Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand, let me get mines first. Then after I get mine, y’all can do what you wanna do."

[Verse 3]
You know you fucked up right?
You shoulda just said nothing
Now you're going to have to give me a check to stop
All I hear is platinum that platinum this
Meanwhile I’m on the carpet with a platinum chick
I got a platinum rollie, platinum whip
Niggas frauds I told the truth, don’t ask me shit
All this industry fake enemy and rap shit
It’s never really my style we got cash to get
I really started from nothing now it’s back to shit
Puffy almost caught a domestic when he smacked that bitch
Hold up, let that bitch breathe

[Interlude 2: Diddy]
"Yeah, this is called poppin' shit. There’s no cut on it. There’s no cut on it. If your feelings get hurt, you feel like, "Oh, that’s an arrogant little comment—" no, this is the truth and the truth hurts. Haven’t I paid my dues? Haven't I weathered the storm? Didn’t I weather the storm? Niggas is gone and I'm here."

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Eryn Allen Kane]
We don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper & Eryn Allen Kane]
Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line

[BURR]
There’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it

[HAMILTON]
I hadn’t slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

[MARIA]
I know you are a man of honor
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
But I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone…

[HAMILTON]
She said:

[MARIA]
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
Beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone
I don’t have the means to go on

[HAMILTON]
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

[MARIA]
You’re too kind, sir

[HAMILTON]
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

[MARIA]
This one’s mine, sir

[HAMILTON]
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

[MARIA]
Stay?

[HAMILTON]
Hey…

[MARIA]
Hey…

[HAMILTON]
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don’t know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”

[MARIA]
Whoa...

[HAMILTON]
Nooo, show me how to

[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]
Say no to this

[HAMILTON]
I don’t know how to

[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]
Say no to this

[HAMILTON]
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go

[ENSEMBLE]
Go! Go! Go!

[HAMILTON]
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say…

[ENSEMBLE]
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

[HAMILTON]
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

[JAMES]
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

[HAMILTON]
Fuuuu—

[JAMES]
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife

[HAMILTON]
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed “How could you?!” in her face
She said:

[MARIA]
No, sir!

[HAMILTON]
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

[MARIA]
Please don’t go, sir!

[HAMILTON]
So was your whole story a setup?

[MARIA]
I don’t know about any letter!

[HAMILTON]
Stop crying
Goddamnit, get up!

[MARIA]
I didn’t know any better

[HAMILTON]
I am ruined...

[MARIA & HAMILTON]
Please don’t leave me with him helpless (I am helpless—how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
I don’t want you
Whatever you want (I don’t want you)

[MARIA, HAMILTON, & ENSEMBLE]
If you pay (I don’t…)
You can stay
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this (Say no to this!)
Tonight (I don’t know how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this
'Cause the situation’s helpless (Helpless)
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes” (Whoa!)
How can you (No, show me how to)
(Say no to this!)
Say no to this? (Say no to this)
(Say no to this!)
How can I say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go (Go! Go! Go!)
When her body’s on mine I do not say… (No!)

[HAMILTON, MARIA, & ENSEMBLE]
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
No!
Yes (Yes!)
Say no to this!
Say no to this…
I don’t say no to this (Don’t say no to this)
There is nowhere I can go
Go go go...

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Skies]
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"

Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I need some water, somethin' came over me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

Goddammit it, I love my life, Styrofoam cups, no ice
Party 'fore we go inside
Never let them out my sight (ooh), they're right by my side (woo)
Them my ride-or-dies (ride), them my ride-or-dies (ride)
My friends are goals, your friends are foes (foes)
We fly, why cry? Our souls exposed, yeah

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Ten toes, ten toes, we was out in that road, uh
Lookin' for love in wrong places, we proposed to a stove, yeah
Share jewels, share clothes, that's how deep this shit goes, yeah
Every week, ya got bros, all of y'all fear closure
Y'all switchin' sides like NBA teams just after halftime
I'm pullin' up on my dog, make sure he okay, I don't even have time
Then copped me a Porsche with butterscotch seats, this 'fore they had mils
Live better than rappers and they don't even have bills, it's that real
Bought Emory a BM as soon as he came home
We hopped on a plane, headed straight to the Bay
That's how we turn the game on, it's game on
Ty mama died, I was there, my nephew died, he was there
He in my house more than I be there, more than Bey there
Ty Ty there, E there, Breezy there, Juan there
High here, Chaka there, Law there, they all here, ah yeah
Dez there, Kawanna here, shit feel like Nirvana here
Crib like the Soho House, I might stay in and grow out my hair
Tight circle, no squares, I'm geometrically opposed to you
Y'all like to try angles, y'all like to troll, do you?
Y'all talk around hoes, do you? Y'all don't follow codes, do you?
We know everything you say from niggas close to you, you emotional
When I say, "Free the dogs," I free 'em, that's how Meek got his freedom
Y'all put niggas on a t-shirt, it hurts you ain't never meet 'em
You got niggas in the feds, you ain't even tryna feed 'em
I'm tryna free the world, that's how deep I'm in
I ain't goin' to nobody nothin' if me and my wife beefin'
I don't care if the house on fire, I'm dyin', nigga, I ain't leavin'
Ty-Ty take care of my kids, after he done grievin'
If y'all don't understand that, we ain't meant to be friends

Uh ain't no pride involved, ain't no pride involved

Point 'em out, out, out, point 'em out, out, out

Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)

I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh-huh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start

Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Oh, when it all, it all falls down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair."
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this."
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch

I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch

Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)

Get girls, but the hooker said you paid for it (Ah)
Me and Rice in a house with like eight floors
Ride your brother's nuts, you're a squirrel for his acorn (Uh!)

[Verse 3: RiceGum, Alissa Violet]
Ayy, you got girls? Where they at? Are you serious?
Ayy, didn't see 'em, like George, I'm just curious
Ayy, Alissa said you cum fast, like the Furious
Diss tracks, you are my reflection like a mirror is (Hooyah)
Wanna flex on my wrist, I put some ice on it
I ain't wanna make her wet, then maybe put some rice on it
Talk shit, now I'm on your head like some lice on it
Heard that you used to bully kids back in high school (Ooh)
Second part for the kill, that's what Rice do (Ooh)
Hit it twice this ain't Insta', I don't like you
Gotta put this rice in this beef like some Thai food
You ain't got no bars, no flow like a lake do (Shit)
Rented cars and that Rollie lookin' fake too
Let's go back to the bully thing, listen here
Was it back in middle school or was it senior year? (What?)
Didn't think you'd get caught like an interference
Pick on others just to hide the fact you were insecure
How you think they felt when they went home and they were dripping tears? (Ooh)
You cheated on a good girl, Tessa's hideous
And then you went and got a big head like you Phineas

[Chorus: Alissa Violet]
It's everyday bro with the same bully flow
Bully at school, now bullying your bro
Diss your own brother, I don't really get it though
Stop bragging, just accept nobody knows your Disney show
It's everyday bro with the same bully flow (What?)
Bully at school, now you bullying your bro
Diss your own brother, I don't really get it though (Yah)
Stop bragging, just accept nobody knows your Disney show (Bitch)

[Bridge: Alissa Violet]
Should've never cheated now, never cheated now
Got fame from your brother now, from your brother now
And he's a better kisser now, better kisser now
Now I'm onto bigger things, bigger things now (Bitch)

[Outro: RiceGum, Alissa Violet, Both]
Should've never cheated now, never cheated now
Now, I'm fucking on your bitch now, on your bitch now (Fuck, fuck, fuck)
You used to be a fan and you still a fan now (What?)
They gon' call me "RichGum" 'cause I'm dumb rich now (What?)

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out"
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Chorus: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy (oof!)
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky (Jerky)
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)

Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough (Yeah)

Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more

Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own

But I believe it's a pathway

With those tattoos on your face?
Say, boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem
To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked, so I might say something back
That might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then you might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause
I'm a sinner, and I, I got a best friend, best friend
Plus balls and intestines, and they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up the minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
'Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend
Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power, now
When I blackout, power outage—oww
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you—blaow
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
Somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance

[Intro]
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo

We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one


Start of song 


[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright

Shit, my type ain't quite her type but now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac

Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl

Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Like, na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
So, I'ma put this dick up all in-side-of-you

I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

Swear I lose my mind every time that I'm in it
You won't get a dime, nah, no, not mine

Spinach, spinach, I been here for a minute, minute, ayy
Playin' games with me, shawty, this is not no scrimmage, scrimmage
Swear that I did it, did it, I do it, I does this, I does it, ayy
Shout out my bloody, my whoadie, lil' nigga, and shout out my bousins, woah
I swear I'm bloodied up B's, never throwin' up C's, ayy

Your bitch pussy nasty as fuck, she got a little bit of yeast, huh
Gettin' all the money, count it up, countin' all my green, woah-ayy
Girl, you got me going out bad

You used to say you in love, yeah, hey

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Ma frappe y'a personne qui l’arrête
Penalty j'souris au gardien
Igo y'a Mowgli dans l’arène
Ciseaux, retournée comme Papin
J'parle pas trop j'me fous du rap
J'négocie l'tarot man
Tes rappeurs c'est tous des tapins
Ils s'passent tous tous la pommade
Toute ma vie j'l'ai ramée dans les ténèbres
J'me réveille j'ai cette haine qui me pénètre
Peu de mandats mais les 'tasses m'envoient des lettres
Mowgli n'aime pas qu'on lui dise "T'es célèbre"
Chaque jour c'est la même c'est le biff qui m'fait frissonner
N'aie pas honte de leur mettre ces pédés, moi j'leur pisse au nez
Né dans la jungle j'suis sauvage un gros oinj pour m'isoler
Les grosses 'tasses qui déboulent sous mon arbre, moi j'les prend en le-le
J'tacle à la gorge comme en BPL wAllah pum pum
Dis à ton pote dans la street c'est la mort ou la bibi
Choisis ton camp mais belek au cas où ça ti-tire
Joue pas l'thug avec ta meuf on sait tu fais l'Titi
J'suis d'l'époque de la Sega j'm'entraîne à frapper comme Sagat
Rico Rico, j'débarque vrr vrr ratatata
Fais gaffe fais gaffe au hebs c'est pa-pata-ta-ta
J'connais le million mais j'chante toujours pas la-la-la-la
Entre nous, trop cramé, ils m'aiment pas, font semblant
C'est chelou, j'suis armé, cœur de pierre, abonné
J'suis Mowgli, j'suis Simba, animal ça s'entend
Hum, hum, dans leurs mères, tu connais

[Refrain - Ademo]
DA, DA, DA
Bats les couilles pour eux j'suis nda (da, da)
Bats les couilles qu'ces pédés m'aiment pas (pas, pas)
Au fait moi j'ai les couilles de papa (pa, pa)
Mon Dieu faut qu'j'me dirige vers la Mecque
Mais bon j'suis d'la pire espèce
Avant j'étais moche dans la tess
Aujourd'hui j'plais à Eva Mendes
Gars, gars, gars, gars
J'ai mal, j'vois mes semblables en bas, bas, bas
Faire rampampampa

[Couplet 2 - N.O.S.]
Hé la, holà ! Tes lèvres ne me font plus penser
Hé la, holà ! Mes rêves ne me font plus bander
J'ai sorti une arme dans l'respect
La patience ? le temps ? pas testé
Gratte pas l'amitié pas d'nouveaux amis
(Pas l'amitié pas d'nouveaux amis)
On enverra Mowgli chercher médaille
J'redoute plus la visite de la flicaille

And got sent to a prison in PC
I seen the devil, he's in you and me
You need saving to listen to this, see
Follow 'em home, cut the right corner so nobody sees you
Turn off your phone
Leave it at home so nobody can trace you
Mask your expressions
Appear to be calm, they won't read your intentions
As soon as you’re in
Let them all know who they’re all in the presence of
I am a murderer
I am a demon, the son of a serpent
What is your faith?
What is your worth?
Have you felt acknowledgment?
If I kill you now, will you go to heaven or hell you believe in?
Death is approaching you
30 seconds to think before lying in a blood sea

[Chorus]
Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard

[Chorus]
Uh, work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', "How so?"
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye

Aprovecha mis horas que son poca'
Cuando pasemo' esa puerta, mi loca
Te vas a hacer la que na' de esto te importa
Y termino de nuevo con otra
Ya ni quiero sacarle la ropa
Dejé de darle beso' en la boca
Quiero la reina, no un cuatro de copas

Girl, quereme
Mi heroína en este lío

[Verso 2: Duki]
Y si te digo que esta pena que siento
Sólo me la pueden sacar tus besos
Y si te digo que puedo morirme felí'
Mientras sea culpa de tu sexo
Y si te digo que el resto nos mira
Como si estuvieran odiando lo nuestro
Y veo tu cara que no te importa nada
Como si hubiera nacido pa' esto

[Puente 2: Duki]
Ella es una diabla
Me ve, me besa, después no me habla
Noche' de sexo, día' sin palabras

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucker mine
Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)
8 and 9, finna shine (Yeah)
On the grind
Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya (Uh)
Where they shoot without a purpose
Services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it
Can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Chorus]
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, RIP to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere, we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]

Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get ya own

[Verse 3: Fergie, Rihanna & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

[Verse 1]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome."
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"Cool, where you stay?"
She said: "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" – "No," she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you tryin' to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

[Verse 2]
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy

[Verse 3]
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes!
I gotta go to the county buildin', man
These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?
I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)
Kenny! (What?) You on his voicemail! Damn fool (Oh) Shit!
(K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!)
Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn!
(Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard and squab, homie)
Just let me—Kendrick
When you get this message, man, call me back
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' about some damn dominoes
It ain’t all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear yo' ass!
Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Hook]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Interlude]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Verse 1]
It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Interlude]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Verse 2]
Uh… time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, "Thanks so much," you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

You don't own me
You don't own me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 2: Grace]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 3: Grace]
You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay

[Chorus: Grace]
Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

You don't own me
You don't own me
You don't, you don't
You don't own me
You don't own me
You don't own me

Hello?
Aw shit, nigga! The fuck time is it, man?
Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[Verse: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)
*Gunshot*
Ayo, Big! Ayo, Big!

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
But baby, wait! – "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend

How we had the club going up

I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
It ain't no way, no how
I made it on my own
I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Got the club goin' up

[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I’ve never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I’m gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show ‘em that your color is black (well all right)

[Verse 1]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right

[Verse 2]
Damned if I do (shit)
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

I can't be what you want from me, well all right

[Bridge 1]
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

[Bridge 2]
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie

Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie

[Intro: The Game]
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, "Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?"
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical"
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 1]
I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now
The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now
The xannies help me slow up, the lean it help me speed down
Ballin', yeah I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now
Callin', yeah she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial
Driving through the Rex I look at faces don't see no smiles
It's grimy in the 6, who can I trust? I'll never know now
Sprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound
They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down
See me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now
I don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down
Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 2]
I remember being a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Outro]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in

Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!

Jamais négro s'enterre en vie, jamais négro ne baisse les bras
J'illumine, j'élimine, ennemis, imminent
Pas d'paroles, patates sur les lips
Si j'urine dans la ville, c'est que j'suis sur les Champs
Grosse salope, quatre pattes sur le bitume
Inoffensif je fus, une offensive et je tue
Une gencive de plus, sur le bitume, j'accumule embrouilles, bagarres de rue
J'prends le réseau, négro, j'te laisse que l'WiFi
Au studio j'fais qu'du sale, au studio tu n'fais qu'du bruit

La même bitch qui me tournait le dos m'a en photo dans l'appareil
Bientôt riche
Quand Mwaka Moon aura fait mouche

[Couplet 3 : Kalash]
Ding dong, v'la le Mwaka
J'marche dans la ville comme une âme en vrac
En attendant qu'ils tombent sous le AK (brrr)
J'observe comme King Kong au-dessus de Manhattan
Voilà déjà une plombe que j'suis fracas
Allongé dans une tombe pleine de vieux tracas
Je viens d'un autre monde, ici, je ne m'y fais pas
Que cela ne t'étonne, je viens de là-bas
Tout ceci est louche

[Refrain : Kalash]
Un peu d'Amsterdam dans la bouche (yaw yaw yaw yaw yaw)
Une bouffée d'oxygène dans la kush (yaw yaw yaw)
Dans le vide je respire à peine, le succès m'a donné des ailes
La même bitch qui me tournait le dos m'a en photo dans l'appareil
Bientôt riche
Quand Mwaka Moon aura fait mouche

[Outro : Damso & Kalash]
La vie c'est dur, un peu comme ma bite
Elle m'a fait gagner des femmes mais perdre celle que j'aimais
Mon jus d'amour, sur tant de visages, j'évacue ma rage par galipettes
J'dis pas les mots car pour moi ils me tuent
J'nique des mères pour la dînette
Des étalages de tous mes disques
Et puis que tu me dises j'aurais pas dû naître
J'pars dans le Mississippi, là où personne sait qui j'suis
J'suis damné, j'suis rôti
Dent d'or dans biscuit
J'bois encore et encore, histoire d'oublier mes torts
Sur une bête de beat de Pyroman sous les feux de la rampe, je me brûle les ailes
Oooh
Aaaaaah, Mwaka Moon
I'm fucking out, aah

[Intro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Outro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

Takeoff, I'm the bird keeper, let the birds fly
Why you tryna take my prize? You a dead guy
Of course, I gotta keep a watch out through my bird eye
No casket, drop dead fresh and I got dead guys
Don't discriminate, ball players come in all sizes
Finger roll, post move or the pick and roll

Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me

You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)

Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames

I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)

Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Chorus]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)

That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup

Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this

And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like "Woo, that boy got bars"
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need"
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever livin'

Women, weed and weather

Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand me downs
See if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first - Cali

Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?

But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now

Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
"I gotta get paid!" — well hey, but that's the way it is

Things'll never be the same

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that's the way it is

Things'll never be the same

Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 2: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

That's breastfeeding while we fuck (Fuck you)
Finna get the dick wet and firm (Firm)
You better sweat me out of my perm (My perm)
Can't wait 'til it's my turn
I wanna blow bubbles with sperm (I blow)
Wanna hit it from the back
Let me arch my back
Once I arch my back
That mean attack this pussy
Don't need a pornstar
'Cause I'm the moderin'
All my spit on his dick
Sound like I'm gargling
Make him bust three nuts, is the task (Ah)
My panties stuck in my ass (Ah)
So I pulled them down to show him the pearl
Made his pubic hairs curl fast

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusin' your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in a hotel room

Hate! Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh

Hate! You keep askin' me where I'm from
Hate! About the borders and, "Did I run?"
Hate! Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
Hate! There's a light and dark army, which side you choose? Oh
Hate! If not now then when?
Hate! And if not me then who?
Hate! Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
Hate! I tried to tell y'all about this dude

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't; the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful—blasted-boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen

[Chorus: Justin Vernon, Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher? So high

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word—haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Ugh!)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Ugh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put the sights over
Getting 2Pac money, twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings, never stumble, retracing my steps

I don't give a fuck how hard it get, that lil' bitch know I started this
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, get to the cash, no layup
Spend a big bag, Rodeo, some may ride for the fresh cut
Hoes come through just to touch us, I'ma tell the truth like Usher
You already know how I bust her, slang my chop from Russia

[Interlude: Fat Pat]
Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop—pop my trunk, dip—dip—dip—dip
Swang—swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop—pop my trunk, dip

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on the alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high, above the rim
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film


Start of song 


[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 2]
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Verse 3]
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

[Chorus]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher

[Intro: Prodigy and Havoc]
Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

[Chorus]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'

[Chorus]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Outro]
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money

I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience
'Cause we've been going over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it lick it inside and out
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never getting in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)
We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 2]
You don't need a shower, you already wet
Know that pussy power, telling me, I ain't ready yet
I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby
When I lick it, I put tears in it
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything
Know my lovin' don't change
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say
'Cause you fine, baby
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)

No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 3]
Baby, I promise I won’t tell nobody
Just long as you let me hit it like every night
I could give a fuck ‘bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste
Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm

Rest in power, it's all about power
Squeeze two lemons together and really all you'll have is sour
Diesel, niggas'll smoke your ass to have the juice
Riding around in an all black coupe
Couple of pigeons that's ready to shoot, shit
Ducking and bucking and dodging and dropping
With 48 ounces and cigarette butts
Fucking around with the up echelon
They will turn you to cubes and I hope you be gone
Envelope, overload, cranium overdose
Denny Cascade, what the fuck is the halves
Click clack, get powed, bitch, it's a wrap
Tierra my witness, I pray for a nap
Youngin' and restless, return with a past
Key in ignition, foot on the gas
None of you niggas is acting that jab
Gold teeth in the Glock and a Cybertech mask
Ring gun, particles, turn you into molecules
Planet shrooms, planet shrooms, I'll take you to my panic room

That boy not gang, no, that boy not my friend
I hang with my gang, the same gang that felt all of my pain
When I was struggling through the rain
When I had no guap with no ice
Wasn't no food but rice
All of these bitches they want me but they get one night
Fuck 'em, I give a fuck what you sayin'
Bitch nigga know I ain't playing
I'm 'bout my fetty
Sailing Team armored, we ready
Fuck up that nigga if he talk out too heavy

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, said "Fuck it"
And salesman's like "What up, what's your budget?"
And I'm like "Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds"
He said "I got the one for you, follow me"
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)
Of a leather seat between your legs
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey

[Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards

What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

[Verse 4: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out "Who that is?"

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, "You need to slow down"
"Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down"
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)

But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)

Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh

Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)

Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, "How my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

Young Money, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you

And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you

Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)

I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José

Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can

Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days ‘til Friday
I’m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

[Bridge: Rihanna]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been

Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (mhm)
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'

Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stockbroker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!

Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed

Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper

And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill, everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest of fruits
And the thirst is the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

The story of my lifetime

Pain of a brother, your dirty mother

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)

Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute

Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production  (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2

1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza’s expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

You have your orders now, go, man, go!

Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry

When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting—

We had a spy on the inside. That’s right

After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it’s over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they’re singing…

Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours

Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'ma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

Got neck from all these thots I sex

I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin', I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man, I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'ma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

I know you scared

Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you oppas
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM be the clique, bitch, you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces, bitch you T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck wit my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin'
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

[Chorus]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain't bout it, bitch how you figure
I don't do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin'
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of 'em bitches
I don't wanna do no songs, I don't wanna kick it
And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out
Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt]
'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From a city that's recession-hit
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt]
'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk
Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down
Bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real
Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwin' out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm gettin' money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein'
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't trippin' long 'cause I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas sprayin' K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once

[Verse 1]
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea (Uh)
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you: *clap clap*
Zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna

So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
I'm a Blue-Eyes White Dragon while you're just Dark Magician (Oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation, but
I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it comes from a mumble rap community
No papa, no papa, yes papa; Johny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fuckin' party with some—

Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls"
"All of the lights," she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"
[—Chloe Mitchell]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?

I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before!"
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him. I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!

[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last; Tunechi

[Hook: Drake]
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police!"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

[Hook: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow>
Yeah, that's good

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect

You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (Look)
(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)
Love, love, love

(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)

I'm in love (Love)

Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes

Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
I know they want my downfall, lil' nigga, are you laced?

[Chorus]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I’m ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I’m gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want  some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want  some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

[Verse]
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up

I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)

My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Hook 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like "doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Hook 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still "nigga, what is you sayin'?"
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: "Hello? What you doin'?" — "Kickin' it."
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

They say, they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an advisor, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge

From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeah—yeah
Like yeah, like yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (Preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (Preach)

You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (Preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (Preach)
Just as long as they never say (Preach)

He had to flex to be acknowledged (Ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (Ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (Ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me, on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck."
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know

When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed

All of the things that I did back then

All of the things I did back then

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you

That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk
And what about Boston? Look at the cost
N' all that we've lost n' you talk about Congress?!
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)

My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

[HAMILTON/ANGELICA]
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

Take a break

[HAMILTON]
I am on my way

There’s a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

Alexander—

[HAMILTON]
Okay, okay—

[ELIZA]
Your son is nine years old today
And he has something that he’d like to say
He’s been practicing all day
Philip, take it away—

[PHILIP & HAMILTON]
Daddy, daddy, look—
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can’t write mine
What!
I practice French
And play piano with my mother (Uh-huh!)
I have a sister
But I want a little brother (Okay!)
My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq! (Bravo!)

[ELIZA]
Take a break

[HAMILTON]
Hey, our kid is pretty great

[ELIZA]
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate

[ELIZA]
We can all go stay with my father
There’s a lake I know…

[HAMILTON]
I know

[ELIZA]
In a nearby park

[HAMILTON]
I’d love to go

[ELIZA]
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

[HAMILTON]
I will try to get away

[ANGELICA]
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days
It says:

[HAMILTON/ANGELICA]
“My dearest Angelica”

[ANGELICA]
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written

[HAMILTON AND ANGELICA]
“My dearest, Angelica.”

[ANGELICA]
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait

[HAMILTON AND ANGELICA]
You won’t be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

…you’re not joining us? Wait

I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate

I know I’ll miss your face—
In a nearby park
Screw your courage to the sticking place—
You and I can go
Eliza’s right—
Take a break and get away— (Take a break)
Run away with us for the summer—
Let’s go upstate (Let’s go upstate)
Where we can stay
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time—
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now— (You will make your mark)
Close your eyes and dream—
We can go—
When the night gets dark (When the night gets dark)
Take a break (Take a break)

Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks

Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill
And what it is?
Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill
Yeah

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

[Intro]
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up (Up, up)
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)

Everywhere I go (Hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (Wow)
750 Lambo in the Utah snow (Skrrt)
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared (Wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (Cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (Kid)
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit (Yeah)
Used to have a lot, but I got more now (Yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (Yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Hey)

[Verse 1: Logan Paul]
Little brother Jakey try to roast me? (What?)
Little brother standing on his own two feet? (Not for long)
I'm a dog, you're a puppy, call you Kong
Let's talk about your garbage that you call a song
It should be every other day, just some strong advice
I made you famous once, it's about to happen twice
Yeah, you on Disney but who helped you read all your lines (That's me)
Don't forget boy, you were my shadow on Vine
Now you got a few subscribers and you think that you're the shit
I'll admit, you got money, you got bars, you got chicks
But you're a dick, you ain't thankful for your fans, it's kinda funny
Do your investors know Team 10 ain't making any money?
See, it starts with the talent but it's hard when you got none
I think you kinda salty 'cause I'm the favorite son
I'm a maverick, you're a sidekick, yeah I brought you to LA
If there's one thing you should know, you don't fuck with the Logang

[Verse 2: Daniel Seavey, Jack Avery, Corbyn Besson, (Zach Herron) & Jonah Marais]
Hold up, I'ma throw up
Looking at your face you don't know what it means to glow up
Trying to dance and acting class
It's doing nothing now you try to rap
Come on, hold up
Catch the flow, you can't, oh no
(Maybe Team 10's got it), I mean, that's how you grow
But you still can't sell out any shows
No, you still can't find some matching clothes

[Refrain: Why Don't We & Logan Paul]
Yah, yeet
You're just killing the vibe, yeah (Fact)
You ain't doing it right, yeah (Double fact)
Trying to play ball with the dogs
You don't know what you've done you just ruined your life, yeah
You're killing the vibe, yeah
You ain't doing it right, yeah
Trying to play ball with the dogs
You don't know what you've done you just ruined your life, yeah

[Bridge: Logan Paul]
What happened, Jake?
Man, we used to love each other
After all, we came from the same mother
Biologically, you know that makes us brothers
So much negativity, it really makes me wonder
I feel like you just need a maverick shirt (Link in description!)
When you insult me Jakey, it really hurts
Sometimes I wish my real brother was Dirk (Disney)
But now I gotta go and put you in the dirt

[Interlude: Logan Paul]
Yo, wait, hold up
Hold up, why'd music stop?

[Verse 3: Logan Paul]
Uh oh, that's Alissa Violet, used to be your chick
Now she in the Logang and you know she on my... team
Those cars ain't yours man, that shit was just floated
Gun tattooed on your leg 'cause she knew you weren't loaded
I act in movies that your fans watch with their babysitters (Airplane mode)
I thought you were my boy, guess I have a baby sister
You're tryna be a model, shoulda kept Neels Visser (Ha-ha-ha)
Go make another video 'bout who's the better kisser
Is it called Team 10 because you take 10% of your friends? (That's fucked up Jake)
When the contract dies, so does their career, it ends (That's also a fact)
Are you mad because you couldn't sign the Dolans? (They're smarter than you)
So, you had to replace them with some Spanish twins? (Ha-ha-ha weak)
It's everyday bro, do you give up a night?
We 24/7 man, you picked the wrong fight
I'm a savage, you are average, I’m a beast, I’m going wild
This song will be the death of you, I'm 'bout to be an only child

Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)

On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's-snot gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Prr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
And nominally I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it

Never be as good, never be as good

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Chorus: Bosx1ne]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol s'ayo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Verse 1: Jnske]
Eto nanaman tayo, kailan ka 'ba matututo?
Pag-ibig ay sakit sa ulo
Kaya 'wag kang magpapaloko
Bakit ba ang bilis mo na maniwala d'yan?
'Di ka pa ba nadala sa'yong nakaraan?
Ilang beses pa ba na kitang papayuhan?
Ayaw ko lang naman na ikaw ay masaktan
Hindi kita sa dina-down down down 'pag pumili ka
Kase karamihan kasi now kung makuha madali
Madali lang magpakamot 'pag may nangati
Kaya ngayon palang mag-isip ka 'pre (yah, yah, yah)

[Verse 2: Flow-G]
'Wag kang mangangamba kung iiwanan ka na nya
'Wag kang mag-alala kasi marami pang iba
Idaan mo lang sa tawa kaysa magpakatanga
Hanggang sa masanay ka na kasi ganyan talaga sila
Baka 'di mo alam na hindi na bilang
Sa daliri ang binibining sasaktan ka lang
Kaya easy ka lang, 'wag kang magpakahibang
'Wag mong gawing mundo yung alam mo na tao lang
Alam mo yan kaya 'wag mo nang lokohin ang sarili mo
Hayaan mo sila na maglaway, kakatingin sa'yo
Hanggang sa silang lahat naman ang maghabol sa'yo
'Pag nagawa mo yan ay tsaka na'ko bibilib sa'yo

[Chorus: Bosx1ne]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo, lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Verse 3: Brandon]
Gagamitin lang nila ang 'yong pagiging sikat
Sabi ko sa'yo diba, 'di lahat ay tapat?
Na mga bitches na tanging riches
'Wag ilahat ang pagkatao mo at feelings
From the beginning hindi sapat!
Hu u? ka na 'pag gusto napasakamay
Unti-unti kang gagamitin para sokeramai
Kaya tawanan mo na lang pare, 'di yan kawalan
Dapat tayo yung lalaki na iniiyakan

[Refrain: Brandon & Bosx1ne]
Kaya hayaan mo sila na maghabol sa'yo
Para 'lam nila 'di tayo basta basta pwedeng sayonara
Kaya sa'kin magtiwala madami pa d'yang iba
Konti na lang tayong pogi sa mundong natitira

[Verse 4: Bullet D]
Di ba sabi ko sa'yo, wag nang uulit?
Ang kulit mo ring kaibigan ka (Hey! Hey!)
Ilang beses na ang puso mo'y napunit
Nagagalit pag sinasabihan ka (Oh yeah!)
Makinig ka sa akin alam ko na rin
Galawan ng babaeng ikaw ay papaasahin
Kaya kung ako sa'yo ay 'wag na (wag na)
Tanga yung taong nandyan na para sa kanya
Kaso binalewala dahil lang sa salita
Ang lakas lakas manggamit ng hindi mo halata
Ganyan na talaga ang nagiging sitwasyon ngayon
Wala na akong masabi basta alam mo na 'yon
Kung ano yun!

[Chorus: Bosx1ne]
Kalimutan mo na yan, sige sige maglibang
'Wag kang magpakahibang, dapat ay itawa lang
Ang problema sa babae dapat hindi iniinda
Hayaan mo sila ang maghabol sa'yo diba?
Sabi ko naman sa'yo, lahat yan nagloloko
Pagkatapos kang pakinabangan, biglang lalayo
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa
Kaya 'wag nang uulit pa

[Verse 5: Skusta Clee]
De-de-de There's so many bitches in the club (In The Club)
There's so many sexy babies ba't hindi ka maghanap?
Iinom nalang natin kasi yan!
Bawal ang malungkot pare, hindi pwede yan!
Sa 'kin makinig ka pare!
Sa panahon ngayon wala ng matinong babae
Maniwala ka sa 'king mga sinasabi
Alam ko 'yan kasi diyaan ako nadale
So it's time to say goodbye-bye, say goodbye
'Dun sa girlfriend mong tsupay, set up tonight
Wala nang chick ngayon na totoo
Lahat nagloloko ay nako, kung ako sa'yo (Ohhhh..)
Kalimutan mo na yan!

[Verse 6: Jroa]
Hey dude, just listen to me now
I say, I say hey dude, 'wag kang magpahibang
Dami-dami diyang iba, 'wag kang magpakatanga
Buksan mo lang ang mata at ika'y mamamangha
See them pretty ladies in the club tonight
Ba't 'di ka pa kasi maghanap? (Yeah, right)
Itapon mo ang nakaraan, bye bye
Buddy, just stop wastin' your time
'Wag mo na kasing pilitin pa
Kung ako sa'yo, mag-enjoy ka
Hayaan mo na maghabol sila
Ituro mo diyan sa 'kin at tutulungan kita na kalimutan
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only

Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

Never disrespected plus I'm well connected

Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing

(That's my sauce, look it up, look it up, find it)
Addin' up checks, no minus
(Add it up, add it up, add it up, add it up, yeah)
Get your respect in diamonds (ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice)
I bought a Plain Jane Rollie, these niggas bought they fame (woo)
I think my back got scoliosis 'cause I swerve the lane (skrr)
Heard you signed your life for that brand new chain (I heard)
Think it came with stripes but you ain't straight with the gang (gang, gang)

Walk it like I talk it (walk it), walk it like I talk it (yeah)
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we been beefin' dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home
(She at home now!) That was that, so
I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps, though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa
Name ringin' like a Migo trap phone, whoa
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's
That's on Tommy Campos, we live like Sopranos and I—

[Chorus: Quavo]

Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)

[Verse 3: Offset]
Woo, woo, woo, Offset
Niggas pocket watchin' (watchin')
I want that thot, this thot, ménagin' (which one?)
I bought a franchise to double up the profits (franchise)
We make a landslide, chopper get to poppin' (landslide)
Eliott got me rocky, pour sake, chicken teriyaki (brr)
Takeoff, rocket, keep 'em in pocket
Water gon' lock it, quadruple the profit (profit)
I walk like I walk (hey) talk like I talk (woah)
What’s in my vault? Load of cash and assaults (brr!)
I put a lab in my loft (lab)
She cook up and jab with the fork (jab)
By the pair, I got karats that choke (by the pair)
By the pair, I got karats each lobe (by the pair)
Private life, private jets 'round the globe (private life)
Hit a bitch, hit a lick with the 'cho (hey)

Ballin', somethin' we do often (ball)
Take the pot and I'm splashin' up, dolphin (splash)
I take the nine and go buy me a faucet (nine)

[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali, mm

[Chorus]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church
(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony
Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him
(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
I'm persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen

[Verse 1]
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Chorus]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is aching, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let’s turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove]
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in hotter this year (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound, you kill the Inc. 
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you jet ahead
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free

Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Intro]
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah

Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

[Post-Chorus]
I was hot as hell out in the heat (Yeah, yeah)
Then a storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Roll)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Oh no)
Niggas femalin', they excellin' (Yeah)

We propellin', up top with Ellen, uh (With the choppers)
Kill the jealous with propane repellent
Got me goin' crazy (It's lit)
On tour, we'll tell 'em, we brought the section (Gang)
They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic (Brrt)
Like we projected
So we cut the plug, he's interjected (Got me goin' crazy)

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
(Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed
(Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week
(Alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down

"A bitch is a bitch. So if you're poor—"
“It was once said by a man who couldn’t quit, dope—”
“Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say”
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
"Here's what they think about you"
"That punk Ice Cube—"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Cube was suckin' so much New York dick"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Real Niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace"
"Here's what they think about you"
"Why y'all let his punk ass in the group"
"Here's what they think about you"
"When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube"
"Here's what they think about you"
"When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back"
"I smell..."

Fuck all y'all!

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into something
Gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No vaseline
Mothafuckin' nosejob having ass
Mothafucking Jheri Curl lite
Ambi wearing mothafuckin' bitch

[Intro]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

[Pre-Chorus]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

[Chorus]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause it's all that I ever had

Oi, rudeboy, shut up
How can you be better than me?
Shut up

Tell my man-
Look
Couple man called me a backup dancer
Onstage at the BRITs, I'm a backup dancer
If that makes me a backup dancer
The man in your vids? Backup dancer
The man in your pics? Backup dancer
Man wanna chat about backup dancer
Big man like me with a beard
I'm a big man, how the fuck can I backup–?
Army comes everywhere I go
I can't run when my enemies show
Walk in the club with all of my tugs
Party's done, everybody go home
Apart from the girl dem, you lot stay
Walk in the club, all the girls say, "Hey"
Tell a man like I'm K to the A
There's no champagne, we don't rave
Yeah, I'm the best, I'm so cocky
I've got a mob like A$AP Rocky
I set trends, dem man copy
They catch feelings, I catch bodies
They roll deep, I roll squaddy
Got about 25 goons in my posse
They drink Bailey's, I drink Vossy
I get merky, they get worried
If you got a G-A-T, bring it out
Most of the real bad boys live in south
If you wanna do me something, I'm about
I'm not a gangster, I'm just about
But you see my man over there with the pouch?
Dare one of you man try get loud
All of my mandem move so foul
I might sing but I ain't sold out
Nowadays all of my shows sold out
Headline tour, yeah blud, sold out
When we roll in, they roll out
I'm so London, I'm so south
Food in the ends like there ain't no drought
Flipz don't talk like he's got no mouth
I wanna make my mum so proud
Like, "Yo, Mum, book a flight, go now"
All of my ex-girls stalking me hard
Talk to my face, don't talk to my palm
Had four bills and I bought me a car
Little red whip that I bought for my marge
I straight murk, it's a walk in the park
I take care when I water my plants
These MCs wanna talk about Lord of the Mics
You ain't even lord of your yard
Dead MCs, blud, leave me alone
Me and your girl, we speak on the phone
Kill a whole crew of MCs on my own
Kill a whole crew of MCs for the throne
I was out hungry, so damn hungry
Man tried to eat then leave me the bones
Now these niggas, they need me to grow
Hot chocolate and a panini to go
I'm a big man, fuck a postcode war
Man were upset about the MOBO Awards
Yeah, I was gassed at the MOBO Awards
Why? 'Cause I ain't won a MOBO before
Duh! All of you MCs sound so bitter
Shut down Wireless, shut down Twitter
Shoutout Deepee, shoutout Flipper
Best my age, yeah blud, look
If you don't rate me, shame on you
If you don't rate me, shame on you
Can I order a deathbed for a MC?
Wait, he wants beef? Let me make that two
Anyone else wanna make that move?
Anyone else wanna pay their dues?
Imposters wanna take my tunes
Stiff Chocolate, yeah, my face so smooth, check it
Don't even talk too much, you're a talker
Dem man still go halves on a quarter
Saw me turn from a prince to a pauper
Two cigarettes and a bottle of water
Told the bouncer, get the bottles in order
Man in the kitchen putting in orders
Stiff Chocolate, skin clear like water
Smooth on this ting, start locking up daughters

[Outro]
Yeah, so shut your fucking stupid mouths
Chatting bare fucking shit
Shut the fuck up, shut your fucking mouth

IHeartMemphis, but I also love dancing
I done took off on 'em, I don't plan on landing
I call shots just do it like Nike
No FaceTime, but the people want to Skype me
If I do time, then who would really write me?
I stay on y'all mind but, “Oh, I think they like me”
Clean pair of sneaks with a designer belt
Please watch your step, 'cause I'm feeling myself
Throw a flag on the play, man somebody get the ref
Go, "Blah la la la low," man, somebody get some help
Pulled up on the block

Pull up on the block and do the dance like crazy
This chick is hella hot, but I know this chick crazy
If I think she not, then that makes me crazy
We are both thots so we are both are crazy
Flexing always on my agenda
Your whole team rats, your CEO is Master Splinter
'Bout to hit the Quan and turn that girl into a member
Now my whole team flexing, I think we got a winner
People want to dap it up but they can't get none from me
I went to jail and snap it up, at least I had bum money
People wanna walk around me tryna steal my lingo
Just make sure when you talk about me you say he's doing his thing though

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan

The reason why we like this—this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff—they don't understand, it's because we really from Africa. And that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying? So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things. It's in our genes, know what I'm saying?

Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby

I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick

On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer

Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

[Post-Chorus]
I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves cloves cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

[Verse 1]
Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Verse 2]
All these parties I attend
But never know the celebration
I let you do what you want
No need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud

Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVSs on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest

Count up a hun', cop a Rolex

Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CCs you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking, "Where the codeine at?"
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet

Stand for something, or die in the morning

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches

It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 1]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

[Verse 2]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)

[Sample]
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
Get hurt, boy (Get hurt)
Aww, here go another muhfucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy (First)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (Worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy (Hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now (Ga, ga, ga)
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (Hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (On the road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)
I give a fuck about old, boy (Man, that boy old)
I give a fuck about his squad, boy (Man, that thing old)
I give a fuck about your mob, boy (Oh)
I'm the real 6 God, boy (Whoa)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
(I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too)

[Break: Jessica Vielmas]
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
Housekeeping, housekeeping
(What I got to do to get to you?)
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
(To you)
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
¡Disculpe!
(What I got to do to get to you?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk, [gulping]
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell them to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you [gulping]
I'm 'bout to hurl, I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass a long time ago
You should've feeled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money
Can't stop a suicidal weakness

[Intro: Raekwon & Method Man]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, CREAM get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!

[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Bridge: Inspectah Deck]
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down

[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM, get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us

You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]

Go back home, money, go back home

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1]
Man, I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumpin' Raw with the shit blarin'
Saying "Fuck school!" and droppin' out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed
I played a part in this devilish game
Makin' your common sense perish
But I ain't takin' the full blame
'Cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rottin' from weed
You feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
Makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like, "Yeah, he got it from me"
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word "fun," what do you envision?
Probably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
With clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition
Is that all you think life really is?
Well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain — give me it!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
Well, let me guess — no
You're only in school because your parents make you go
When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
Yo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause
You're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw — you literally do nothing at all!
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have, 'cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is, "I got money and it's stacked to the roof"
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
You wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
And regret it all 'cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
With traits like Romeo — bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!
You always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
And you want somethin' real — shut up, tramp, save it!
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'
Pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'
'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few Corona's
They always shoutin' and wild out
With habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talkin' about, "Oh my god, I can't find a guy!
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!
Why am I even on Earth? I should die!"
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'
Try a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'

[Verse 3]
The term "real nigga" is publicly used
And I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused
Are you one for always bustin' your tool
With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
To homies up in your crew?
Is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you?
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
Nah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?
'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law
You're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
I can't even fuck with you
'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothin'
Livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
And starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'
Look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your "real nigga" talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused

[Verse 4]
To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
See, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue
The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
All you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass-control limit was breached — fuck hip-hop!
They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
They purposely makin' the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Hook: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Pre-Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

Look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 1]
Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware, this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss, move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
Yeah, this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
Yeah, my dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me, ah

[Interlude]
Yeah, rah, rah, okay

[Verse 2]
Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled: Freaks and Geeks

If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence

I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)

It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out

I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

I'd rather be realer than you

I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
"No, he's not around." Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it—not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Hook: Eminem (& JAY-Z)]
—renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie"
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

Nouveau riche, ma Lamborghini a pris quelques dos-d'âne

Personne dans le monde ne marche du même pas

Toujours d'humeur à les lever, que l'avenir suce mon troisième doigt

Y'a du son, d'la chatte, du shit, y'a le Nueve-2i dans le coin
Grosse bite dans la chatte du SMIC, coup d'pied retourné dans le groin
Bombe nucléaire sur le game, il ne restera que moi et les rats
Quand j'monterai dans la Veyron, jamais tu n'me reverras
Inspiré par la musique de ces descendants d'esclaves
Ils achètent négros sur place publique, pour eux rien n'est grave
J'ai couronne sur la tête pourtant c'est le voisin qui a eu la fève
"Il n'y aura jamais de trêve" m'ont dit mes khos du 93
Braisé poulet, locos, bananes, le rap c'est haram
Génocide sur ces négros, j'vais les Boko Haram
Ne fais pas trop de bien ou tu seras cloué sur une croix
La rafale dans ta grand-mère arrivera plus tôt que tu n'crois
La race humaine me dégoûte, j'allume gros pilon au chalumeau
Nique ta fondation de merde, j'préfère sauver les animaux

[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like nigga move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
"Cash Rule Everything Around Me"
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?

We forgive you, for you know not what you do

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
7 A.M. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it, let's see if for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guns, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, "Give me back me money!"
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, "What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum

[Verse]
The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at all

Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

Went to the show sitting in the front row
In a black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know and it's shutdown

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, take time
If a man wanna try me, no time
Usain Bolt when I run up on stage
I pick up the mic and it's reload time
Don't know your songs but they know mine
That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind
After the show I be rolling mine
Don't care bout the no smoking sign
They try to steal my vision
This ain't a culture, it's my religion
God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen
Me and my Gs ain't scared of police
We don't listen to no politician
Everybody on the same mission
We don't care about your -isms and schisms

[Hook: Skepta]

You wanna act like a G for the camera
You say you're Muslim, you say you're Rasta
Say you don't eat pork, don't eat pussy
Liar, you're just a actor
Blud, you're not on your deen
And if Selassie saw you he would say
"Blud take off the red, gold, and green"
Them man are soft just like ice cream
Szeen? Start moving correctly
If you don't wanna upset me, you get me?
You tryna show me your Fendi
I told you before, this shit don't impress me
I bet I make you respect me
When you see the mandem are selling out Wembley
Roll deep in a blacked out Bentley
Pull up outside like "wah gwan sexy"

Yeah, and it's shutdown

A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV

[Verse 3: Skepta]
I'm in a different class
When I get through I'ma bring my dargs
2 by 2, man a walk on the ark
Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks
Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark
Upset cause man are way up right now
And the shit happened all so fast
I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc
New York, shut down Central Park
Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?
Walked in, spat ten 16 bars
And each and every one of them came from the heart
None of my lyrics are stolen
"Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan
Wanna know how I did it with no label
No A-list songs, and I told them

Blud, I just shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown

If I'ma talk, I'ma talk, I'ma keep it real
Me and my boys, and my boys, we would split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill'
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout-out to Hawk, shout-out Dooly, shout-out Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros 'til the death of me
Nobody, nobody know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah, they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my fuck, and my tongue game a remedy

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no

[Verse 2: Nav]
Way, we got 'em feelin' some way
Way, 'cause you see XO in the place, told her, "Wait"
I gotta get myself together, it's a date
I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say "this shit is wack"
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her "Stop it"
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)

[Part I: Dance with the Devil]

[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was makin' a million
Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of 13
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities in other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed

[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Startin' fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well-guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted
So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three

[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone
Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head
And knocked her onto the floor
"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screamin', "Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!"
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lyin'
Bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

[Sample]
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow
He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever

[Part TII "I"]

[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back
Into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit
Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit
I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
Go ‘head and grip Glocks
I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I’ll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface
I’m overheatin' your receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick
In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece
I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece
I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
So you’re nothin', like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven
You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked

Want you to know how it went

Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home

Je meisje is een mots, ze had seks met je pa
Geen blad voor me mond maar recht voor me raap
Ze zullen er niet zijn als het slecht met me gaat

[Couplet 4: Ronnie Flex]
Ey bitch schuif op, wij komen binnen met z'n allen
Je moet zakken tot de grond alsof je moeder is gevallen
Ik ken bitches zoals jij en ik vang ze elke keer
Morgen weet je zehma niks meer
Dat maakt niet uit want ik vind het wel goed zo
Ik bel Kleine en ik zeg kom langs bro
Misschien dat mn libi vroeg afloopt
Je ruikt wiet en seks als ik langsloop

Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Couplet 1]
Elle voit la taille d'mes jouets
Évidemment qu'j'suis joueur
J'ai plus peur d'échouer
Noyé dans des larmes de douleur
Tes diamants, sèche-les
Quand elle brille tout là-haut
Elle nous voit j'réalise à quel point l'ciel est beau
J'ai les mains sur une crosse, le teflon sur le dos
Dans l'vent et la braise on a grandi
Mais j'veux mourir près de l'eau
Hein, faut qu'j'la sorte du coma, avec ou sans love
Stoppés par l'temps, l'égo, l'amour du mauve
J'cause au mur j'entends dans ses murmures qu'j'ai mis son cœur en lambeaux
Hier encore t'avais mon nom sur les lèvres
Depuis l'aube t'es plus la même
Où qu'on aille tu m'as dit aimer c'est pas le tout
Rien n'est à moi, rien n'est à nous
Ma santé pour un SMIC, j'préfère crever riche et solo
Teille j'zone ivre, crosse celui qui s'met devant
Ma vie dans un disque, mon son dans ton bando
À nos morts, à nos restes en photo
Te-tê haute, nés pour mourir debout
On affrontera quand même
J'ai oublié comment vivre
Tant qu'le soleil s'lève avec ou sans love
Tant qu'mère n'est pas sauve
J'suis parti j'ai pris des risques
Mais j'vais pas revenir pauvre
J'te l'ai dit j'tiendrai promesse
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
J'ai du temps j'ai peu sommeil
Ma gorge nouée, mes peines en chiffre
Si tu m'entends j'suis entier
J't'ai dit chérie attends moi j'suis en guerre
Tu m'attends, tu m'perds
D'puis longtemps j'le savais j'ai vu clair
Laisse tomber j'ai plus mal
J'parle à la Lune j'vois ton reflet dans l'eau

[Refrain]
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule

[Couplet 2]
Quand les regrets reviennent
J'repense et j'tourne en rond
Jamais plus je n'te dirai bébé reviens
Tant pis pour le reste j'ai pas r'tourné ma veste
Tu t'es sentie seule dedans
Quand le temps passe les plaies s'estompent
On oublie pas on vit avec
À nos morts, à vous
Gouache sur les phalanges : violent
J'ai grandi j'ai plus les mêmes hantises qu'avant
J'ai choisi de le faire à leur détriment

[Refrain]
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule

[Couplet 3]
J'affronterai quand même
Tant qu'le soleil s'lève
Avec ou sans love
Tant qu'mère n'est pas sauve
J'suis parti j'ai pris des risques
Mais j'vais pas revenir pauvre
J'te l'ai dit j'tiendrai promesse
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
J'ai du temps j'ai peu sommeil
Avant d'm'avoir dit je t'aime
M'as tu dis je t'aide
Va de l'avant réalise tes rêves
Père et mère vieillissent
La meilleure ou la pire chose qui m'arrive
Ce qu'elle me donne
J'en veux plus j'allais mal t'as joué l'aveugle

And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep

Ayy, I just decided by the grace of the god Poseidon
That you're so dead to me I dug a hole for you to lie in
I'm sick and disowning, all the moments, and the key components
That led me to follow hollow promises from empty monads
It's 11 degrees and I can see my breath so I know I'm breathing
But I got no pulse, I swear to Thelema my heart ain't beating
I better get back to the black hole sun
Leaving my gun, I don't need it for this one
I'm finding the silver lining and I'm mining for hope
Tryna keep my wrists closed

Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had eight proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch, drugs while on the clock

[Part 1]
Kid, ich bin der Mac in diesem Business und ticke dicke Packets an die Kids, stepp' mit der glitzernden Kette
In den Club, zerre deine Bitch auf Toilette und ficke der den arroganten Blick aus der Fresse
Du holst dir mein Album und sagst, ich bin der Beste, doch ich dreh' mit deiner Mutter Porntapes
Komm' in deine Villa mit der Basey, gebe deinem Body Punches, alle deine Rippen zerbersten wie Cornflakes
Keiner dieser Rapper kann so viele Bitches zu derselben Zeit in zehn Städten haben, ohne dass die Weiber irgendwann checken, was abgeht
Kid, ich hab' allein in deiner City circa sieben oder acht Babes, was geht?
Und ich mache Business und tick' an all die Sluts H, roll' in deine City rein im silbernen Lex
Mache deine Lady, die du liebst, zu deiner Ex, sie vergöttert meinen Body, Kid, ich baller' mir das Flex
Habe danach mit der Nutte circa sieben Stunden Sex, alle Gs in deiner Town wissen, mein Wort ist hier Gesetz
Kid, ich komme mit der goldenen Kette, baller' dir Wannabe da voll in deine Fresse - besser renn in dein Versteck!
Rapper wollen gern eine Kollabo, kommen an und callen dann den Mac am Handy - leider ist immer besetzt
Denn ich habe keine Zeit für diese Penner, Kid, ich mache lieber Business in Holland, habe kiloweise Pep
In dem Kofferraum und roll' über den Zoll, ich mache Money mit der Ware, Motherfucker, komm mir nicht mit deinem Rap
Ich habe leider keinen Nerv für deine „supertollen“ Tracks, deutscher Rap ist eine Bitch und ich versorge sie mit Crack
Mache mit der Nutte Cash - und es wird immer mehr wie von allein, Kid, ich habe 'nen Lauf wie meine Tec
Gebe keinen Fick auf deine Gang, komm' an und zücke meine Gun, baller' dir Kugeln in den Head und du verreckst

[Hook]
Uziläufe schwarz wie die Mondfinsternis
Ziele mit der Gun, kille deine Gang, rolle weg im Jeep
Baller' Luden tot und das Rotlicht erlischt
Kugeln in der Luft, renne durch die Hood, volles Magazin
Guccijacket weiß, das ist Kokstickerbiz
Lege mir 'ne Line, rolle mir 'nen Blunt, holländisches Weed
Lass' die Lady tanzen auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Ich zerfetze Rapper mit 'nem Messer, besser gib mir deine Kette - Penner, renn, ich bin der King in dem Block

[Part 2]
Kokstickerbiz, ich spanne meine Muskeln an und erzeuge damit eine Mondfinsternis
Rapper ballern Steroide, machen dann auf harten Bodybuilder, doch blicken zu Boden, wenn sie Kollegah trifft
Und ich gebe keinen Fick auf deine Doubletimeflows, ich vertick' an deine Mama das Coke
Sie kann nicht bezahlen, denn die Bitch hat keine Kohle, gar kein Ding, ich lass' die Nutte vor der Kamera blow'n, uh
Und du siehst im Internet, wie deine Rapidole gern auf Über-G mit Taschen voller Money machen
Aber kleine Insiderinfo: Die meisten dieser Penner sind in ihrem wahren Leben geradezu broke
Ja, all die dicken Karren in den Clips sind nur geliehen, die Bitches haben nicht mal Führerschein, das ist alles nur Show
Der Einzige, der real geblieben ist in diesem Game voller Versager, Bitch, ist Kollegah, der Rest sind alles Hoes
Und du weißt: Ich könnte, wenn ich will, alle die sogenannten Rapperkarrieren in diesem Land ohne Probleme zerficken
Mit einem einzigen Track, aber dafür bin ich leider viel zu busy mit anderen Sachen - wie zum Beispiel ihre Mütter ficken
Nachdem diese Bitches meine Villa sauber machen, mir dann liebevoll den Nacken massieren
Und dann auf allen Vieren gehen mit Augen, die vor Freude glänzen wie der Mond oder die Felgen an dem Benz voller Chrom
Komm mir dumm und ich halt' dir die Tec an deinen Head, zieh' dann den Trigger, Mutterficker, du bist tot
Und alle deine Möbel in der Wohnung werden rot wie die Augen deiner Mutter, wenn sie weint um ihren Sohn
Es ist der Boss, ich durchstreife im Maybach das Viertel, die meisten MCs haben keinerlei Würde
Sie ficken nur Crackschlampen - ich stoße Chicks von der Bettkante, die sie heiraten würden

Kugeln in der Luft, renne durch die Hood, volles Magazin
Guccijacket weiß, das ist Kokstickerbiz
Lege mir 'ne Line, rolle mir 'nen Blunt, holländisches Weed
Lass' die Lady tanzen auf dem Wohnzimmertisch
Ich zerfetze Rapper mit 'nem Messer, besser gib mir deine Kette, Penner renn, ich bin der King in dem Block

She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, "Damn Durk I like the way you hittin' it"
Don't believe the rumors, girl

Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel

'Bout to cop the house way up in the hillies

[Intro: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you, looking for a brighter season (Yeah)
Need to lay your burden down (Haha)
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling (Dutty, young blood sucka')
Buried under deeper ground (Uh)
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

[Chorus: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Uoy ereht yeh, uh, give me a sec, look
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh, okay, okay
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw

[Verse 2]
If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his horse
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

[Chorus: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh
Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh
My hypothesis is-is, death ain't shit
Uoy ereht yeh
I'd rather die than be alive in this life
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Honestly full of trife and strife
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh
Jah

[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'—

I want it flowin' through my streams
Gettin' me hot
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up

Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' (Yeah)
Controllin' how you moving, lucid dreamin' (Dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood (It's lit!)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (Yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah!)
Bend her over for some piping (It's lit!)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightning (Pop it)
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep (Sleep)

I don't wanna wake up (Yeah)
Want you spread out on the sheets (It's lit!)

When I wake up (Yeah, yeah)
Want a drop top on the beach (Straight up!)
Getting me hot, yeah (Yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh!
And if I OD, I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo
And the doors goin' up, suicide

[Chorus 1: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets
(Want you spread out on the sheets)
'Cause that pussy so good (Pussy so good), yeah
Girl, that pussy so sweet (So sweet)
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)

Cussed out or coming up short

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

[Chorus: André 3000]
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but

Cuffing is dead

That's what this good pussy do (It's whack)
Came through on dat late night
Sent fo' me first class flight (Commercial)
Follow me might learn something
Stop trippin' might earn somethin' (Ha ha ha)
He won't ever love a square bitch (A square bitch?)
Baby you gon' have to share him
Ya nigga been down with OPP
I hate to be the one to tell ya

When he leave you he gon' text me (Uh-huh)
And I'ma ask him what that mouth do (But what yo mouth do?)
I can't help it that I'm this sexy
See you might be able to cuff some
But that nigga ain't gon' be none of 'em
See, that nigga love him a bad bitch (Which is me!)
And everybody havin' fun wit' him (That's why he wifed me)
See that nigga ain't no exclusive (Yes he is)
Girl, you out here looking stupid (Bitch, you look stupid)

I'm just telling you that you don't know what you doing (I wanna beat this bitch ass bro!)
The type of nigga you pursuing
Is the type that ain't gon' love you back (But he love me though)
He love what you do for him
But he know I ain't doin' none of that
See, he know I ain't having none of that
And I won't ever be his wifey (But you ain't got no choice)
Whenever you get out ya feelings bae
You might wanna do it just like me (Like you?)
See, me and my bitches don't save em (You a rat!)
We catch his ass and we throw it back
Break his ass down like a pound

Bitch don't play yo self ain't nothing 'bout that nigga godly (That's mine)
He ain't just for you, baby, he for everybody

That little change that he throw yo way
Ho, I spend that shit everyday

You probably wanna be quiet Miss
Cause I ain't never been tried, sis

No contact, no photos
Never seen 'em in the daylight
Do you know what the nigga really look like? (I don't care)
I mean wow,  thought you were winning 'til now?
Sonin' you bitch, you my child (Nah, you ain't my mom)
You living foul, you need to polish up bae
Basic shit I don't allow
And that nigga about to get his too
Just as soon as I'm done with you
'Cause them other niggas might be for everybody but

So get it right bitch, I'm wife bitch
And can't nun of y'all hoes replace me
You proud to be this nigga cumrag?

She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

[Verse 2]
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high

[Verse 3]
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that butt 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Start of song 


[Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, 10 million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Hook 1]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my 16 dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh)
He said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' "I don't care, just bite me!" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns ‘cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus"? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Hook 2]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson’s a] faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Hook 1]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)

Crache-moi d'ssus j'te lance une bouteille
Difficilement je trouve le sommeil
Menton pointé vers le soleil

J'te baise j'te laisse à l'hôtel
J'passe au Lamborghini, Maybach, Phantom tu restes à l'Opel

J'la mettrais ienb' tout le week-end

T'as l'swag à Sacha Distel

J'n'ai qu'confiance qu'en mon Desert Eagle et en Zizou dans les arrêts d'jeu
Elle est dans la chambre, elle est sous les draps (hum hum*, )'ai des jambes à la place des bras
Elle pense que j'suis en train d'la doigter (hum hum*, )'lui mets mon gros doigt d'pied
Mes deux questions préférées : qu'est-ce j'vais faire de tous ces deniers ?
Si j'te fends le crâne en deux, quel œil va s'fermer le premier ?
Continue à glousser, j'te fume et j'roule un trois feuilles
Tes ongles continuent à pousser tu pourras griffer ton cercueil (2.7)

Nique sa mère, même une sexagénaire
La juge m'a dit que j’exagère
Mais nique sa mère là-celle aussi, son arrière grand-mère aussi
Rien à envier à ces hommes, leur meuf est bonne, la mienne aussi

J'suis en couleur, t'es mal sorti
J'suis Marlo Stanfield, ta mère la hyène, t'es McNulty

Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (Ooh)
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak (Now, now)
Now he shooting his shot like drive-by

If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me ('Cause you are)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died

I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (you, you, you)
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'ma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it, yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

[Chorus (Extended)]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Bridge: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1]
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC—me—Jay-Hova
Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringin' a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringin' them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama
We kill you motherfuckin' ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you dunny ‘cause I overdo it
So you won't confuse it with just rap music

[Chorus]
R.O.C., we runnin' this rap shit
M Easy, we runnin' this rap shit

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little fuck, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushin' weight back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella students of the game, we passed the class
‘Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you."
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level, get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no!

[Chorus]
R.O.C., we runnin' this rap shit

[Verse 3]
I know you miss it Nas the (fame)
But along with celebrity comes 'bout 70 shots to your frame
Nigga, you a (lame)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started, but now you're just garbage
Fell from top 10 to not mentioned at all
To your bodyguard's Oochie Wally's verse better than yours
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin' song
But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine
That's why your (lame) career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then
I know who I paid, God – Serchlite publishin'
Use your (brain) – you said you've been in this 10
I've been in it five; smarten up, Nas!
Four albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every… let's say two, two of them shits was doo
One was "nah," the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average
And that's so (lame)
Nigga, switch up your flow, your shit is garbage
What you tryin' to kick, knowledge?
You niggas gonna learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen
Because you-know-who did you-know-what
With you-know-who, but let's keep that between me and you

[Verse 4]
A wise man told me don't argue with fools
‘Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga, I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed, now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you
Nigga, I know you well, all the stolen jew-els
Twinkletoes, you're breakin' my heart
You can't fuck with me; go play somewhere, I'm busy
And all you other cats throwin' shots at Jigga
You only get half a bar – fuck y'all niggas!

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
I know you’re busy

[HAMILTON]
What do you need, sir? Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna give you a word of warning

[HAMILTON]
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

[WASHINGTON]
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

[HAMILTON]
You’re kidding

[WASHINGTON]
I need a favor

[HAMILTON]
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

[WASHINGTON]
Shh. Talk less

[HAMILTON]
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—

[WASHINGTON]
I need you to draft an address

[HAMILTON]
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—

[WASHINGTON]
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President

[HAMILTON]
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

[WASHINGTON]
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry, what?

[WASHINGTON]
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

[HAMILTON]
No, sir, why?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna talk about neutrality

[HAMILTON]
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—

[WASHINGTON]
I want to warn against partisan fighting

[HAMILTON]
But—

[WASHINGTON]
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

[HAMILTON]
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve—

[WASHINGTON]
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I—

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

[WASHINGTON]
No, they will see we’re strong

[HAMILTON]
Your position is so unique

[WASHINGTON]
So I’ll use it to move them along

[HAMILTON]
Why do you have to say goodbye?

[WASHINGTON]
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

[HAMILTON]
One last time

[HAMILTON]
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

That my country will
View them with indulgence; (View them with indulgence)

Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers (Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers)

George Washington’s going home!

I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners
(You got scanners, we got scanners)
Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
Obama said "Chill, you gonna get me impeached"
But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach

Uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (Bang!)
Catch a body, head to Houston
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusing
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
Oh, you gonna learn today

The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit

Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar

One day everybody gotta die, oh

One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Locked in my room, four black walls
Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up 'til I fall
Murder on call with the *59
Twenty years, and it seem like a lifetime
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smoke, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Ho, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and live for the lesser
My birth was an error

[Verse 2: LORD OF LONELINESS]
I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
This world was never made for me
Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes
I'll shank my knees, then walk the plank and freeze

[Intro: The Game]

Mars..
(Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' martian)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

[Verse 3: The Game]
(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do
Cause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy

I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
And I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death
And I don't need no fucking help

So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't Be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

[JAY-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[JAY-Z: "so what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: "Come on, let's just go"]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight."

[JAY-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"

So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like "love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know it was foul, baby
Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!

And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past

Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, ya heard?
Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G-shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Gonorrhea, all that shit
All of that shit
I catch all diseases in the world
So the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?
G-shit
Yeah, yeah
(P. Soul on the track)

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb
You think you got a little buzz, so now you can't get stung?
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Murder these flows like I murder these ho ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a ho, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more

I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby

An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave

My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane

I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do

Jeden Tag eine Party

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, he-e-ey

Its elemental no need
To be judgmental or accidental
Use your mental methodically
Periodically set an electron free
Now I’m charged positively
It’s me Mr. B-E-A-R-D
So there are 90 elements
That occur naturally
There’s radioactive decay
The rest are made artificially
Mendeleev through the scientific method
Had realized the heart of chemistry
He knew undiscovered elements existed
To fill the gaps like he had predicted
Other scientists persisted
To keep the table unrestricted

Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

Mass hallucination, baby

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"
You can't be serious, man

[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
Oh yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' "I can do you right, do you better than your exes"
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'
Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
It's so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

[Intro: Wale]
The time is now, on everything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

[Hook: Wale]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

[Hook]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Verse 3: Wale]
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit, I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything, and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

[Outro: Wale]
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition

Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now I'm sittin' in the club in a different bag now
Baby when I pick it up you gon put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the DJ turn it up, what the fuck is that sound?
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit (This is my shit)

They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)

Topping the charts, Ace in my cards
Choppa my locka when I'm writing these bars
Koka Kola veins, I'm insane
Trip through memory lane
Out in Narashino and I see my own white shadow
A tad too close, rad with a bad diagnose
Coke-filled nose, too weird for them other fuckboys
Catch Lean and Sadboys out in Europe, sippin' Cristal
I'm smoking loud with my lost boys
All this money don't make me sad though
Rubber bands in my pants bro
Don't close your eyes and lean back though
Y'all ain't ready for the Lean attack though
Lean, lean, lean, youngin' with my team

Water in my lungs, finna quest, I won't hit the earth
Fire, water, dirt, too turnt, too burnt
Make mistakes, I guess I'll never learn, see, see, see that's my firm

She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga
Shootin' that "Too Fake" video, my nigga, we all in
We set ourselves apart from all our apartments
Was up in Florida, no Marlins, nigga
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon, nigga
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo' bae list
Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list
I been working 8 days a week
I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went Super Saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites nigga
I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don

This a pain song but I'm letting everything go

Until death call my name
Ayy, ayy, Youngboy, slime yeah (Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playing though)

[Chorus]
Too many problems, yeah
Thinking how I'm gon' solve it, yeah
So much pain in my body, yeah
They selling lies and I bought it, yeah

You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got my static when you ride with me
We get pulled over no you ain't going to do no time for me
I put my hands up police drew down on me
So many charges make me wanna go away overseas
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was sittin' up in that cage
I was begging you to stay and you hung up in my face
Free Kodak, everything gettin' slayed
They keep begging me to change
Talked to Future the other day and he say I need to change lanes (Yeah)
Cause they gon' try to count you out til you make them count you in (Yeah)
Stimulate my brain (Yeah, yeah) had to tell 'em I ain't leaving out the same way I came in (Yeah, oh, fuck what I saying)
Whole lotta heroin, I sell that shit right in front of my momma
Swear I would never run just like a man I'ma face my problems
Even when my voice fucked up
I'ma spit in the booth I'ma go in like a goblin
Nigga got me fucked up
I'ma spin on his block, I admit that I had shot him
VVSs in my chain tell that ho Young Thug everything
Hearing voices in brain hoping everything change
I been rolling through the streets and been clutching on my heat
I put blood all on my feet and I put cameras in my trees (Baby)
Said I changed on you, but I feel that you changed on me (Changed on me)
I said my prayers and you gon' sow just what you reap (Yeah)
I been taking Adderall mixing it with lean (Mixin' it with lean)
Hope I don't wake up out my sleep

Don't tell me that you love me if you ain't gon' die for me, yeah (Oh)
You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah (Oh)
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah (Oh)
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah (Can answer wishes, slime)

[Verse 2]
Being in love never help me solve my problems (Solve my problems)
I wish that I could find a girl just like my mama
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but still ride around with that chopper (Yeah)
Zoe life to the end, tell them free the main sniper (Tell 'em free Kodak)

Tell the plug that I'm lookin' for an increase
Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece
Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like Wal-Mart
Sippin' Bordeaux out in Bordeaux
Hazard lights flashing on the four-door
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to the Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit
Double cup, gold wrist

Two kings on the big screen
Niggas seen a 36 at 16

Nigga's stick dirty but his dick clean
My money goin' on the deep end
Talkin' half a milli' for the weekend
Contract like a nigga play defense
Curtains in the Maybach bitch peek in
Now the bitches wanna car hop
6 cribs for the cars in the car lot
Dope boys on the goal nigga
Went gold 6 times for a gold digger
Black bottle and a bad bitch
Club Armani where the cash is
Dubai I can do it like a sheikh
Top floor nigga, Burj Khalifa!

Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Is it truth or it's fiction, is it truth or it's fiction?
Is Hova atheist? I never fuck with True Religion
Am I down with the devil cuz my roof come up missin'?
Is that Lucifer juice in that two cup he sippin'?
That's D'usse baby welcome to the dark side
Coulda got blacklist for the crack shit
White Jesus in my crock pot
I mix the shit with some soda
Now I'm black Jesus turn water to wine
And all I had to do was turn the stove up
Beast Coast, winnin' at life, nigga, cheat code
The hatin' is flagrant, hit your free throws
The devil try to hit me with the RICO, them black people
Devil want these niggas hate they own kind
Gotta be Illuminati if a nigga shine
Oh we can't be a nigga if a nigga rich?
Oh we gotta be the devil that's some nigga shit
You seen what I did to the stop and frisk
Brooklyn on the Barney's like we own the bitch
Give the money to the hood, now we all win
Got that Barney's floor lookin' like a VIM
Black hoodie, black skully
Bravado like Mavado, boy I'm that gully
Gettin white money but I'm still black
All these niggas claiming king but I'm still that

From a lie, the devil is a lie, I'm the truth, yeah

I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ayy, ayy, ayy (Tryna get in)


Start of song 


Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him

In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?"
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible."
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!

If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck safe sex!"
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

Why am I such a dick?

Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It's on, nigga, fuck all that bickerin' beef
I can hear sweat tricklin' down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thunderin', shakin' the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn, like "Disco Inferno"
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know; the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G., it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me, two Glock nines
Any motherfucker whispering about mines (And I'm)
And I'm Crooklyn's finest (Crooklyn's finest)

I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker, G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect, I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop you
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan, I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and—

Come here, come here (It ain't gotta be like that, B.I.G.)
Open your fucking mouth, open your—
Didn't I tell you don't fuck with me? (Come on, man) Huh?
Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me? (Come on, man) Huh?

Can't talk with a gun in your mouth, huh?

All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies

Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic

Fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2]
Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But, baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me, girl, 'cause you wanted to have fun

[Chorus]
If it hurts (Woo) to breathe
Open a window (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, your mind wants to leave but you can't go (Ooh)
This is a happy house
We're happy here in a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun)
Fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun to me)
Fun, fun, fun, fun (Ooh)

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

[Verse 3]
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) (Ooh, ooh)
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Bring the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Intro]
Es wird langsam Zeit, mich zu der Scheiße hier zu äußern
Die Lügen, die du über mich verbreitest, in ganz Deutschland
Früher war es „Fick die Polizei“ oder Louis V
Heute sind es LKA-Beamte und Security
Wie es heute ist, war nicht unser Wille, ehrlich
Welcher Sklave macht über hundert Mille jährlich?
Kenneth sitzt bei stern TV und lügt, um sein'n Ruf zu retten
Doch du würdest eigentlich so gern in mein'n Schuhen stecken
Du bist vogelfrei weil du den Ehrenkodex brichst
Du bist nicht int'ressant für diese Medien ohne mich
Ich bin angeblich Sklave der Familie Abou-Chaker
Schäm dich – Arafat war sowas wie dein Vater
Du hast dank uns gelebt so wie ein König in Berlin
Ein Vermögen hier verdient, plötzlich hör' ich, dass du fliehst
Du hast vergessen, wo du herkommst, das Geld raubt dir die Sinne
Aber kein Problem, ich helf' dir auf die Sprünge, Kay!

[Part 1]
Ich erzähl's dir nochmal, warte kurz
Ich fang' an nach der Trennung deiner Nabelschnur
Irgendwo in Ravensburg
Für dich ist die Bonzen-Gegend sowas wie die Bronx gewesen
Man könnte auch von „Malibu's Most Wanted“ reden
Mit deinen Durags und der ekligen Baggy
Dachtest du im Ernst, du bist der schwäbische Nelly
Überheblicher Kenny wollte unbedingt so hart sein
Plünderte sein Sparschwein und gründete dann Chablife
Doch mal angenomm'n, Jaysus hätt' sich deiner niemals angenomm'n
Dann wärst du nie vorangekomm'n
„Wie schreibt man ein'n ganzen Song?“ – Der Typ war dein Lehrer
Als Dank dafür belügst und betrügst du ihn später
Und dann zogst du wie die Heuschrecken weiter
Jeder wusste, Nummer Eins in Sachen Deutschrap war Staiger
Du unterschriebst den Bunker-Deal
Doch anstatt dich mal zu freuen
Ging's dir damals schon nur drum, ob du genug verdienst
Du hattest ein paar echte Freunde, doch lieber
Hingst du ab mit irgendwelchen Boygroup-Mitgliedern
Du dachtest, es wird Zeit, dass ich den Bunker verlass'
Daraufhin schrieb deine Mutter ein Fax, könnt ihr Staiger fragen
Nach ein paar Tagen fiel dir auf, dass du 'ne Wohnung brauchst
Ab jetzt lebt Kay bei Akay von Overground
Und tauscht das erste Mal Freunde gegen Fame
Räudiges Benehm'n wird man später häufiger noch seh'n
Läuft bei dir, Kay – traurig aber wahr
Jetzt muss der nächste herhalten, Hauptsache ein Star
Dann hast du Eko Fresh getroffen, der glaubt, du seist begabt
Der, so gut er konnte, dein'n Aufenthalt bezahlt
Der dich bei sich wohn'n ließ, es ging nicht um Million'n-Deals
Sondern, dass du Promo kriegst und auch ein bisschen Kohle siehst
Erinner dich, Kay, die Kölner hab'n dich mit ernährt
Im Café den Clown zu spiel'n war dir ein paar Kippen wert
Sie besorgten Nebenjobs, damit du was dazuverdienst
Doch seit dem ersten Clip mit Eko fühltest du dich zu berühmt
Er rief Olli an, doch der schickte auch kein Geld
Weil dein Stiefvater wollte, dass du auf die Schnauze fällst
Er hat nicht an dich geglaubt, als Ek an dich geglaubt hat
Und was machst du aus Dank dafür? Du haust ab
Gibst schon wieder dein'n Gönnern ein'n Laufpass
Kay, du wolltest unbedingt zu mir in die Hauptstadt
Doch du hattest zu mir gar kein'n Draht
Also krochst du erst in Saad sein'n Arsch, tja, so kennt man dich
Du wolltest Backup-Rapper werden bei ihm
Hofftest insgeheim, er nimmt dich mit, hierher nach Berlin
Aber nein, Kay – es tat sich nichts, also kam dir die Idee
Dass du mir einfach bei MySpace 'ne Nachricht schickst
Du hast gelogen, Saad hätte dich abgezogen
Auf diese Weise suchtest du den Kontakt nach oben
Ich wollt' die Schulden deiner Mutter bezahl'n
Zu diesem Zeitpunkt kannt' ich deine Mukke nicht mal
Ich lud dich ein – Schweiz, Silvester, Solo-Show
Du warst für mich sowieso nur ein Clown wie Cosimo
Wie ein Landstreicher bist du mit mir heimgefahr'n
Blind, du hast nicht mal deinen Eltern Bescheid gesagt
Seltsam, deine Art, doch du hast mir leid getan
Schulden hier, Schulden da – der arme Kay, der Pleite war
Ich bin darauf reingefall'n und hab' für dich gesorgt
Und alles, was du brauchtest, hattest du sofort
Ich hab' für dich gebürgt und mich grade gemacht
Alle haben über die blondierten Haare gelacht
Und Arafat nahm dich mit ins Katzbach-Café
Und machte allen klar: „Keiner lacht über Kay.“
Er sagte nur: „Der Junge ist jetzt einer von uns.“
„Und einen von uns behandelt keiner wie 'nen Hund.“ – yeah
Es gefiel dir, wie ein Cowboy durch die Stadt zu reiten
Du wolltest unbedingt „Bilal Abou-Chaker“ heißen
Disco rein, Disco raus, Party mit den Fotzen
Jeden Tag besoffen und Ari trägt die Kosten
Wie oft hast du eine dicke Lippe riskiert
Weil du wusstest, wegen uns will keiner ficken mit dir
Denn Berlin hat kein'n Respekt vor einem Metrosexuellen
Aber Papa Arafat regelt das mit Schellen
Und heut hast du die Dreistigkeit zu lästern
Doch er hat seine eigenen Cousins geschlagen, weil sie zu dir frech war'n
Du legtest dich in Sachen Ari jetzt ins Zeug
Und so wurde er dein allerbester Freund – Jackpot
Für jeden deiner Studiotage hab' ich geblecht
Bares und Schecks, wie du weißt, bezahl' ich gerecht
Ich nahm dich mit auf jede Tour – Österreich, Deutschland, Schweiz
Damit wollt' ich zeigen, Kay, was Freundschaft heißt
Bracht dich auf die Leinwand, featurete dich ständig
Für dich war das alles selbstverständlich
Vier Jahre später kam der Hype um dich selbst
„Ich hab', ich hab', ich hab' Style und das Geld“ – yeah
Plötzlich hast du deine eigenen Shows
Es geht um Schicki Micki, Weiber und Koks
Champagne for the Pain, Cocaine für dein Brain
Jetzt hat er, was er wollte, der famegeile Kay
Ich war dir nicht mehr gut genug – du fingst an, auf cool zu tun
Bist abgehoben wegen ein paar Klicks auf YouTube, du
Hast auch versucht, Ari beizubring'n
„Scheiß auf Anis, Mann, wir machen unser eigenes Ding.“
Aber er hat dich nur ausgelacht, was für ein harter Korb
Weißt du, wie man sowas nennt, Kay? Vatermord
Shindy musste her – Prince of Belvedair
Wenig Arbeit, viel Geld und hinterher beschwer'n
Vierhunderttausend hast du minimum gemacht
Aber sag mal: Wie viel gibst du Shindy davon ab?
Kein'n Cent, Kenneth, sag mir, wer ist hier der Sklaventreiber?
Und dein kranker Bruder lebt sogar in Armut weiter
Auf einmal stand der Stiefvater von Kenneth da
Und macht mir ein'n auf überkrasser Manager
Gründet hinterrücks eine GmbH
Ein Typ, so schmierig wie das Gel in sein'm Haar
Geht auf alle Gigs mit, Blitzlicht, Rich Kidz
Hängt den ganzen Tag an Kenny, so wie seine Bitch-Tits
Dann kam diese Nacht-und-Nebel-Aktion
Denkst, der laufende Vertrag hier, das regelt sich schon?

[Bridge]
„Yeah, Kay! Das war dein Leben, dein ganzes Leben. Weißt du noch, damals? Chablife? Royal Bunker? Köln? Berlin? Und wie sie alle hießen auf dein'm Weg bis ganz nach oben, du alte Snitch. Ja, Mann! Und ich hab' so viel gar nicht erwähnt, Alter. Was ist mit dein'n ganzen Droh-SMSen, die wir jeden Tag bekomm'n? Wenn du zu viel Kokain geschnupft hast, Alter. Damit macht man sich nicht cool, Alter. Emory hat das auch gesagt. Aber weißt du was? Emory nehm' ich gar nicht ernst. Das ist genauso 'n Bastard wie du. Verstehst du, was ich meine? Nur eure Hautfarbe ist unterschiedlich. Im Herzen seid ihr genau der selbe Hurensohn. Aber scheiß drauf, Mann. Das war die Geschichte und jetzt kommt das Finale, Dikka. Yeah, Kay!“

[Part 2]
Weil das 'ne Hinrichtung ist, wird heut dein Todestag
Widerleg' dein'n kindischen Diss, der gelogen war
Du und ich wissen: Das hier ist die Wahrheit
Und ab jetzt ficke ich dein Dasein, du Bastard
Hängst am Schwanz von RTL, brauchst wohl deine Promopresse
Aufgeblähte Botoxfresse durch die Alkoholexzesse
Alle Glöckler sind gleich, ob Harald oder Kenneth
Nach diesem Track rennst du Bitch zum Anwalt und zwar flennend
Kleine Kids verdrehen dir den Kopf – Exorzist
Du kommst nach deinem Stiefvater – Sextourist
Mami hat dich lieb, doch wenn die Kohle ausgeht
Lässt sie dich so wie Ley für eine Modenschau steh'n, yeah
Kay, du bist nur der Ladyboy vom Bodensee
Und kannst deine Karriere heut am Boden seh'n
Gern gescheh'n, ich mach' mit deinem Quotenneger weiter
Wegen mir seht ihr eure Homo-Ehe scheitern
Er ist am Telefon – Emory, Fameory
Und nennt dich Hurensohn – Gaymory, Shamory
Ich habe so viele Fragen an euch zwei Opfer
Wenn ich Kay schlage, bin ich dann ein Thai-Boxer?
Ihr habt euch mit den Statements blamiert
Schwarzer Scheißfleck, den die Ray Ban kaschiert
Ihr habt Gay patentiert, macht auf „Fuck Fake Friends“
Doch die allergrößten Fake Friends seid ihr
Yeah, es gibt kein'n Shake Hands mit mir
Geh mal lutschen bei Hallaschka
Dieser Track macht dich kalt wie Alaska
Deine Fresse ist vom Koks aufgedunsen
Wann hörst du die klein'n Mädchen bloß auf zu bumsen?
Prost auf dich, Junge, warst mein Bruder, doch als ich
Hörte, du hast eine von Bisou vergewaltigt
Sie schlief im Hotel, du kamst im vollgekotzten Unterhemd
Wusste ich, du Untermensch landest mal im Dschungelcamp
Es ist Sonny Black, du bist nur irgend so ein wannabe Black
C-Promi-Dreck aus der Dorfdisko
Du bist so undankbar, ich werd' dich stechen lassen
So wie mein Electro-Ghetto-Tattoo auf mein'm Unterarm
Wenn ich will, geh' ich spazieren am Alexanderplatz
Eine Freiheit, die du als ein Informant nicht hast
Du kannst nicht mal an der Ecke zu McDonald's fahren
Dein bester Kumpel ist ein Undercover-Kommissar
Ich häng' mit Gangstern ab, du hängst mit der Polizei
Promigeil im Club macht dein Vater ein'n auf Robert Geiss
Was bringt dir dein Freestyle, wenn wir dich mal holen?
Ich zieh mir V.I.P. rein, englische Version
Früher dachtest du, du bist 'n krasser Straßengangster
Jetzt bist du auf Malle nur ein Mittelklasse-Schlagersänger
Kenneth, komm mal auf dein Ego wieder klar
Du Lachnummer bist nur der Matteo dieses Jahr
31er, hör zu, eine Line macht dich nicht cool
Deine Techno-Junkie-Fans seh'n so scheiße aus wie du
Erinner dich zurück, Echo 2008
Du hast auf dem Scheißhaus gesuckt – bei Lorielle
Das ist nicht irgend so ein Reim, den ich hab'
Er hat wirklich auf dem Scheißhaus gesuckt – bei Lorielle
Das ist nicht lustig, du denkst, der Track hier pusht dich
Aber das hier ist ein Schlussstrich
Kleine Info am Rande, nur, dass ihr Bescheid wisst
Dass jeder, der mit diesem Bastard abhängt, mein Feind ist
Es gibt kein'n Small-Talk, es gibt keine Nettigkeiten
Auf welcher Seite ihr steht, müsst ihr selbst entscheiden
Ich hab' jetzt alles mal Revue passieren lassen
Im Endeffekt bleibt mir nur übrig dich zu hassen
Es ist nicht rückgängig zu machen, ne, Mann
Rest in Peace, Thai-Nutte, Gay One
Ich mach' das hier nicht mal für mich – bei mir läuft, du Spast
Ich mach' das für die Leute, den'n du was bedeutet hast
Für jeden, der dich jemals unterstützt hat
Damit du Nutte heute sagen kannst, du bist was
Für Arafat, ohne den man dich gefressen hätte
Für Shindy, er schrieb dir deine besten Texte
Für Eko, der Freund in deiner schwersten Zeit
Für Staiger, er hat dich zuerst gesignt
Für Jaysus und Crime Payz, deine Jungs im Süden
Menschen, die dir einfach nicht genügten
Für meine Tochter, der ich später mal erzählen kann
Ihr Vater war ein Ehrenmann

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

When you were worrying about pissing on your fuckin' self, I was a stoner

You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken

Super, super fresh with a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy keep the chicks in check
All these car keys drive them chicks to my crib
Dru Hill? Got somebody sleeping on my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she give me head
I just give her beats, I don't give her bread
'Cause we be in the club, bottles on deck
And god dammit, god dammit I'm feelin' myself
'Cause I'm gon' get it all, and I'ma throw it up
Like god dammit, god dammit, I'm feelin' myself
Look up in the mirror, the mirror look at me
The mirror be like, baby, you the shit god dammit

You the shit god dammit, you the shit, you the shit

Pool in the crib you could land a water plane in it
Slick Rick looking at the mirror
Big Daddy Kane bitch like Shakira
1.5 custom made car
Me and Will table looking like the bar
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And I don't give a fuck that's my fuckin' problem

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
And I don't give a fuck that's my whole M.O
I rock the whole globe with no problemo
Been rocking coats since my first demo
And now I'm banging hoes in the Continental
And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride
I open up the doors, suicide
I came from the bottom, the sewer side
I made it to the top cause I do it fly
Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish
I see the whole game from my third iris
I tour the whole word like a dirty pirate
To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly
Up in the club, is where you'll find me
I do it real big never do it tiny
If you about that bullshit please don't remind me
I step in this motherfucker just to make it work
I get on the floor just to make that booty twerk
Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert
Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Doobie in my hand, Rollie on my wrist
Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist
Women in your dreams sleep in my bed
So I don't need your brains I need my ass kissed
But all my homies like give me some head
Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red
Takes shots till our chests burn
We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this let's get it started
The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball
The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star
The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know
The bigger the bank, that's more hoes, nigga
And I done spent a quarter milli' on clothes
Coppin' them old schools and puttin' foreigns on the road
Real talk and if my fuel get low
I roll up another joint take a shot and reload, pow

Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you the bestest"
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Alright, uh
She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me "make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Yeah, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Outro: Nas]
Yeah, a'ight?
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Long Island, yo the world is yours (It's yours!)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours!)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?

When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

[Verse]
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history, baby (Juke), maybe (Juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe (Juke), I'm crazy (Juke)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down," Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
We've got so much history, baby (That's right, that's right), maybe (That's right, that's right)
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you

[Chorus: Towkio]
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

We've got so much history, baby (Juke), maybe (Juke)

[Intro]
No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

[Verse 3: Blackstreet]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, babe
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

[Break]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

[Hook]
No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Maggie in full effect
Lisa in full effect (right)
Biggie in full effect (uh huh)
Tamika in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (no doubt)

Yeah, play on, playette
(Play on, playette)
Play on (play on) play on (play on)
'Cause I like it (right)
No diggity, no doubt

(Blackstreet productions)
We out, we out (right)
We out, we out


Start of song 


[Verse]
Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

[Outro]
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah

Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet, he F with me
That G shall surely see, he definitely as 'bout it
As retail fraud, he's weak, the honest gesture
The trigger finger round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (That's Nickel)
Ridin' round his block
All he know is pitfalls, that's why he always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka!) (Sean Don)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin' (Brr, brr)
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, and just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette (Swerve)
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net (Net)
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me (Me)
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me (Me)
I'm over-respected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon (God)
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?"
(You still ain't got a new line?)
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel (Let's go,) lil' bitch!

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't
Wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryna reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!

Rheinische Straße, bis tief in die Nacht wird von Junkies die Shore gekocht (pah, pah)
Kokaina, Koka-, Kokaina

Lilane Scheine in Steueroasen gebunkert wie Verona Pooth (pah, pah, pah)
Drei Jahre Knast für den Akhi, denn er tickte damals im Range Rover Dope (ah)
Tony Sosa, Tony, Tony Sosa
Macht doch, was ihr wollt, ich bleib' sowieso da
Fick auf dein'n Trainingsplan, Hundesohn, mich hält das Ghetto in Form (brraa)
Der Drei-Sterne-Koch serviert Miami Yacine den Chateaubriand
Scheiß auf dein'n Renault Clio, ich hab' die Chefposition
Mache mit Despo Millionen, es sollte sich lohnen
Sonst schwimm' ich weiterhin gegen den Strom
68er schwarzer Chevy (pah)

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

[Verse 2]
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

[Bridge]
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan

In high school, I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Verse 3: Lil Tracy]
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
Tell me a secret and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique make a ho shake
Black fur, black coat
GothBoiClique in the back, ho
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique 'til my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
GothBoiClique in the castle

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck

[Outro: Both]
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes

[Letra de "Super Jon Z (Residente Challenge)"]

[Intro: Jon Z]
(Young Hollywood)
Jon Z men
Loco, humilde y real, Dios es mi único amigo leal (¡Yi!)
En cuestión de rimar soy Steven Seagal, duro de matar (Rrra)
Dímelo Duran, se ponen pa' mí, ninguno duran
2000 palabras en menos de diez minutos, aquí van (Yi)

[Verso]
Me dicen Jon Zeta
El arma que cargo, es el lápiz y la libreta (Yi)
Ya no asalto con máscara, pistola, escopeta
Ya no vendo coca, pastilla ni media seta
Ahora vendo música sin importar la crítica
Me pongo la túnica y no es pa' hacer mímica (Yi)
Me colgué en once por estar tocando química (Yi)
Me clavé en doce a la maestra de física (Yi, yi)
Yo no soy ejemplo pa' ningún estudiantil (Ja!; buah)
No tengo nada bueno que contribuir (Wuh)
Yo sólo canto lo que algún día viví (Wuh)
Cuando yo vendía droga y me tuve que ir a huir (Wuh)
Se tiraron los tombo' y yo con mi combo
Se bajan del carro, les rompí los biombos (Trr, trr)
Me caí corriendo, me rompí un hombro
Y nos escondimo' en los escombro' (Buah)
Es una anécdota, una historieta (Yi)
Esto no es feka, cabrón, esto pasó en verdá' (Prra)
Por poco ese día me arrestan
Yo cagao', puñeta, me van a llevar (Ya!)
Los otros días me pilló la gente
La DEA y la CIA
Quién lo diría, que me arrestarían
Y que la tarde ellos me dañarían (Diablo)
Antes de llegarle al prom de gratis (Yi)
Me iban a llevar por un poco 'e mari' (Buah!)
Gracias a Dios en Xposed no salí
Gracias a Dios no me pillaron las Pali', ni las Adderalli' (Wuh)
Pero se cayó el caso gracias a Dio'
Y muy importante: nadie me vio (Yah)
Le pagué mil peso' a un abogado
Que hizo un carajo y de nada sirvió (Nah)
Soy de barrio, estoy orgulloso
Todavía tengo el Lancer mohoso
Entregando pizzas era nitroso (Jaja)
Mi flow los tiene mascando groso
Y tuagh-tuagh...
Fumando en el Mercedes, navegando en las redes
Conmigo nadie puede, motherfucker, intercede
Y verás lo que sucede, mi lenguaje es double header (Yi)
Desayuno Fruity Pebbles
Ando con las Vans en una mini van, bien tintia'o
Una guardia me para, me quiere revisar el can
Un saludo a Bam Bam, un saludo a Jackie Chan
Saludo al pesca bicho que me quiere ver mal
A esto' chorro 'e bacalao, le quitamos la sal (Prra)
Papi, yo ya estoy probao', no tengo na' que probar (Yi)
Lo que yo quiero que sepan, es lo que vo'a demostrar (Yi)
Es que el tema de Residente yo lo voy a superar (Ja!)
Sin Bachillerato ni grado asociado
Sin maestría ni doctorado (Prr, prr)
Voy a lograr lo que nadie ha logrado
Nunca ando clean, siempre drogado (Buah!)
Sin cojone' a mí me tiene, a mí ninguno me mantiene (Yi)
Los colegas te buscan más que cuando les conviene (Buah!)
Conmigo no se luzcan ¿Pa' 'ónde' es que tú viene'? (Wuh)
A mí sin cojones los chavo' y to' los billetes de cienes
No prometan lo que no tienen pa' dar
Hablan de países y no se ponen a ayudar
Sean reales con lo que vayan a hablar
A ustede' les importa un carajo lo que vaya a pasar
En el mundo, PR y en Venezuela (Yi)
¿Por qué no se preocupan por su abuela? (Jajaja)
Lírica es real, quizás te duela
Como la verdad, un dolor de muela', yeah

Cómodo, cómodo, con par de putas, exótico (Yi)
De codo me dieron mucho y ahora ven mi éxito (Yi)
Místico, crítico, fumando un pasto épico
Mágico, lógico, lo que canto es verídico
Disparando silabas con saliva (Buah!)
Ando con 70 ladrone' de Alí Babá (Wuh, wuh)
Tiro un tema y obliga'o que pa' arriba va (Wuh)
Súper Jon Z, la máquina de rimar
Estoy mal del coco
Tengo los ojos como el Coreano Loco
Me gustan las doñas latinas con grandes cocos (Yah)
Si veo que eres zorra rápido me embosco (Yi, yi, yi)
Me pego y te mojo, rápido es que yo te toco (Prra)
Un saludito a mi panita Ñejo "El Broko"
Haciendo delivery, el carro yo choco
El seguro no me cubrió ni los focos (Yaah)
Tres tristes tigres tragan trigo en un trigal
Adivina cuántas palabras acabo de tirar (Wuh)
Demasia'o de palabreo, lo rapeo y no lo creo (Wuh)
Grábate éste vídeo que se va a ir viral (Ja!)
Más rápido que Nascar (Wuh), como carne 'e vaca
Tengo el bicho gordo, las patas bien flacas (Yi)
Mai' abre las piernas, Jon Z te lo empaca (Yi, yi)
Pero si te preño, a tu macho se lo achacas
Tengo par de pacas y par de bellacas
Chingo en la hamaca, lo meto y lo saca, jala como un AK
Un corillo de dementes, loco como los de Jackass
No me llevo con las bichis, ni las come caca (Prra)
Ni con las chapis, busca pauta, ni los perros vira lata
Ni con las serpientes, ni los sapos ni las ratas (Yi)
Pero sí con la liebre y la pasta
Y a to' estos raperitos yo los cojo como chata (Buah!)
Flow supersónico, diabólico, magnífico
Te deja paralítico, en estado crítico (Wuh)
Algo explícito, yo leo jeroglíficos (Wuh)
Algo super "Saiyanístico"
Esta palabra me la acabo de inventar (Jaja)
Pero a mí sin cojones, a cojón voy a rimar
Jon habla sin sentido porque dice eso mismo
Si todo lo que yo hablo aquí es verdad
Dímelo va, dímelo wey, wey, everyday, vivo como un rey (Wuh)
Fumo y juego play, real, nunca fake (Ja!)
Aprendo to' los días de los mistakes (Yi)
Me levanto y lo primero el mañanero, wake and bake (Yi, yi)
Aprendí a valorar, vengo de la pobreza
Dios bendiga a mai' que por las noches reza
Gracias a Dios por el pan de la mesa (Wuh)
Y por mi letra que por siempre pesa (Yeah)
Entregando pizzas chocaba los carros
Antes la gente decía que era un charro (Ja!)
Ahora yo lleno de Code un jarro
Y en nombre de ustedes yo prendo un cigarro
Llamo a Manolo, me voy en el taxi
Me tomé una Oxy escuchando a Travis
O un rock de Ozzy, me siento happy
Prende un porro, ponte a Bob Marley (Yah)
Yo no critico, tampoco envidio (Nah)
Fuck lo tuyo, yo tengo lo mío (Fuck)
Me desean el mal y yo te bendigo (Yi)
En los momentos malos yo siempre me río (Jaaa!)
Flow parapelo, yo soy Curry y tú Carmelo
Porque tú me tienes celos es que estoy cogiendo vuelo (Wuh)
Mírame bien, estoy llegando al cielo
Voy a seguir rapeando hasta que sea un abuelo
Hasta que yo muera, y si muero hoy (Hoy)
Saquen to's mis temas pa' que sepas quien soy (Soy)
Pa' que ustedes vean que estoy más fuerte que Floyd (Floyd)
Si me gano un premio no se lo den a Buuoy (Nah)
Pero no voy a morir na', voy a hacer historia
Quemando sativa, voy hacia la gloria (Yi; yi)
Yo amo mi vida, con to'a mis novia'
Y to'as mis chillas, locas y sobria'
Se lo meto como quiera
Es una fiera, pero no es la primera
Entérate cómo, donde tú prefieras
Tu gato se pone bruto, lo coge pera (Yi)

Rompo corazones en to'as mis relaciones
Y todo lo cuento en todas mis canciones
A veces me siento mal, en ocasiones
Pero que se joda, que Dios me perdone (Prra)
Dice' si peco que voy pa'l infierno
Si eso es así, pues que sea en invierno (Wuh)
Antes yo robaba, como el gobierno
Y par de gatas me pegaron los cuerno' (Prra)
Pero que se joda, me lo merecía
El karma siempre llega, y no sabes el día (Yi, yi)
Ya nadie paga, por eso no se fía
Bien, estudiantes, empezó la tutoría (Ja!)
Mamen con mi flow, que me robé el show
Here we go, dímelo Bow Wow (Wuh, wuh)
Que le meto bien cabrón
Y no soy un mamón, le di un slam dunk
No me dieron tapón, me dicen Stephen LeBron
Somos anormales (Wuh, wuh, wuh)
Estilos tengo pales, yo te enseño cuales
Ustedes son mis hijos y les cambio los pañales (Yi, yi)
Siempre se viran los que dicen que son leales
Soy el sujeto y el predicado
Rimando un experto, lo mejor creado
Fuck el pasado, vivo el presente
Yo mucho he llorado por culpa 'e la gente (Wuh)
Falsos amigos, falsos amores
No están contigo en momentos peores (Yeah)
Con una mano cuento a mis mejores amigos
Que son como hermanos mayores (Prra)
Uno es Panny, el otro es Anel (Yi)
El tercero es Benji, el cuarto es José
Y ma' nigga Rotger, cogíamos en boyer
En el Lancer, ahora en el Mercedes Benz (Skrt-skrt)
Un saludo a Neto, un saludo a Caldé
Mi flow apesta, recién lo cagué (Yi, yi)
Voy pa'l putero, tiro una peseta
Pa' que se me doble y la coja Elinnette (Jaa!)
Soy un Real G, y tú Ali G
Tú ere' un wannabe, sendo huelebi'
Empecé de abajo, de lejos yo los vi (Vi)
Pero duro corrí y cabrones, estoy aquí (Estoy aquí)
Yo doy consejo' y no me los aplico (Ja)
Me miro al espejo y conmigo platico (Wuh)
Yo no me dejo y al que saque pico
Sin fantasmeo le rompo el hocico
Soy humilde, manito, no cobarde
Controversial, como Tego Calde'
Salí de la calle porque está que arde
Y de agua fría yo me tiré un balde (Splash!)
Vo' a ser leyenda, voy a ser un king
Sin mucha cadena, sin mucho bling-bling
De tal manera que cuando me muera
A tus hijos, a tus nietos, le hablarás de mí (Skrt-skrt)
Yo sueno Biggie, ustedes small (Buah!)
Ustedes no brillan ni con Armor All (Yi, yi)
Coge pa' la orilla que voy a las milla'
Salte de la silla que ahora voy yo (Buah!)
No soy un personaje, cabrón, soy real (Yi)
Aunque a veces meta un par de embuste' (Buah!)
Yo no le bajé, que tú vas a llegar
A otro niveles, so que hagan ajuste'
Corto camuflaje, las media y las Vans (Wuh)
Me ven y se copian, cabrón, ¿o son embuste'? (Wuh)
Solo me faje pa' poder llegar
El que joda conmigo le zumbo un Hadouken (Wuh)
Bono o encaje, no trate 'e guayar
O rápido mando a que te ejecuten (Wuh)
Hermano, trabaje y no empiece a envidiar
No es mi culpa que mi éxito a ti te frustre
Educado, sin modales, Jon sobresale (Wuh)
Si vas a sacar en cara, manín, no regale'
A los pobres, a los ricos, los trato por iguales (Yi)
Pa' mí no es una ciencia rimar las vocales (Yi)
Te voy a explicar, empiezo con la A
Voy viral, liberal, superar, llegar y triunfar
Y sin limitar, y sin imitar, original (Wuh)
Rimar, improvisar, parar jamás
Llama a la fama, drama, mama cuando grabe
Super Saiyan, vaya usted, sigo con la E
Me fumé, me nublé, me pegué, lo logré
Caminé a pie, y capié dos de diez
Me crié y pasé hambre, y sufrí (Yi, yi)
Sigo con la I, éste challenge me lo comí
Digerí, el beat lo partí, yo no fui
Fue Jon Z o Luis Fonsi
Despaci-to, rimo con la O (Yi, yi)
Yo coloco un poco loco el protocolo como foco
Me equivoco, choco un coco, me sofoco poco a poco
Me controlo y yo solo llego y lo toco (Wuh)
Fumo y enrolo llegando a la lu'
Ahora cierro y termino con la U
Mi juventud me la gozo con actitud
Orgulloso de mi talento y de toda mi virtud
Antes me asustaba cantarle a multitud (Ah)
Ahora yo vuelo a la tarima sin Red Bull (Piu')
Pa'l carajo los partidos, verde, rojo y el azul
Tienen jodio' a PR, en un ataúd
Fuck las vocales, ya las terminé (Yi)
Escribiendo éste challenge en verdad me tardé (Yi)
Dímelo René, en momentos pensé
Que no podía, pero en verdad lo logré
Yo viajo sin ver, flotando en el viento (Wuh)
To' estos rapero' que tomen asiento (Ja!)
Soy el más duro, cabrón, te lo juro
Que una vocal que no exista me la invento (Prra)
No pegué de una, hice muchos intentos
Dale pa' atrás, manito, no te miento (Buah!)
Subestiman mi flow y mi talento
No me la daban y ahora es mi momento
Saludo a Juncos, a to' mis hermanos (Yi)
Yo vengo del pueblo, del Valenciano (Yi)
La cuesta era larga, pero llegué al Llano
Gracias a los colegas que me dan la mano (Yi)
My nigga Rasta, Lyan, Noriel
My nigga Jamsha, Juanka, Darkiel
Messiah, Eladio, El Dominio Nigga
Dimelo Ñengo, y Wiso G (Wuh)
Y a los DJ, como DJ Warner
Filming y Coby que son mis partners (Yi)
Quality y Duran, y Andre Gigante
Torres y Yondoe, son los mío aparte (Yi, yi)
Si se me quedó uno, pues mala mía
No le' hablo a algunos por hipocresía
Pero, bo', normal, yo sigo en la mía
Mientras más me envidian, más me pongo al día

Mm, CP Dubb
Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Refrain]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
We switch the flow up, if you a busta I'ma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

Seventeen, nights stay out past 10
House party ting turn up with your mans
Arguments all day with your 'rents
Just to go out, gotta fight for this shit
Gotta realize you're a high school girl
Don't matter how you put it, used to fuck niggas
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah
But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah

BFF, oh yeah, for sure
Wonder what they in it for
Take your last relationship
Look how good you treated him
You could birth like four of him
Girl, you never needed him

But they still need you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do
Anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music bizz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be

But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care

Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

Bother me, tell me awful things

Hit my side nigga, "Quick, fast! Pull up in that quick, fast!"
I ain't talkin' pancakes, but he flip a brick fast
A bunch of bad bitches, ain't doin' the dab, bitches
Do be in some gangs, couple Cs on their bag, bitches
Fuck you mean? Fuck your little memes
Even Queen Bey had to tell 'em I'm the queen
Check the D, blessed indeed
The executive producer, bitch, rest in peace
Then he put his hands in my pants, felt them thick lips, and got wood
He said, "Kylie, wuss good?" I said, "Miley, wuss good?"
I said, "Could you pay my bills, like O'Reilly? Wuss good?"

Yo, I seen your man post a quote, and a pic in bed
So I hit him in the DM, like, "Hey bighead
'Member when I was your woman crush?", He said, "Yeah"
Told him that I'm headed home, he could meet me there
Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude, that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, "What you like about me?" He said, "That your ass fat"
He said, "Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?"
He said that, "It's abstract",He said, "Yo, yo ass crack!"
I told him "I never front", and then I threw that ass back

Uh, first verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' "Ice Ice Baby"
Screaming, "Shady 'til I die!"
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‘Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's "back" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
"I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian" (C'mon)
Go back and forth and, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power

[Verse 1]
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Takin' some notes and then I write the songs
I’m starin' down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fuckin' me up, and I cried a pond
While asking you for some answers
But we don’t have that type of bond
That my desires gone with the way that I’ve been livin' lately
If I died right now, you’d turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sell-out
'Cause I hopped to Christianity so strongly, then I fell out
Now I’m avoidin' questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feelin' so damn humiliated
'Cause they lookin' at me like I’m hellbound
What story should I tell now? I’ll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof
And I’m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I supposed to do?!
There’s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Beggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen
I can’t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted
These ain’t wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itchin' to get it, I’ve been given assistance
But the whole fuckin' system is twisted
Now I’m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I’ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can’t buy it, it’s just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer, and humans can’t provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It’s truly mind-blowin', I can’t deny it
Is Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where’s the Holy Ghost at? How long’s it take a man to find it?
My mind’s a nonstop tape playin' and I can’t rewind it
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!
I’m frustrated and you provoked it
I’m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it
I have a fuckin' brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source
It’s gon’ be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah’s Witness to come on my porch
I swear I’m slammin’ the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I’m not surprised
Humans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac’s alive
I ain’t tryin' to take your legacy and torch it down
I’m just sayin', I ain’t heard shit from the horse’s mouth
Just sheep always tellin' stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I’m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise?
Sounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!
Show yourself, and then boom, it's done
Every rumor’s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you’re the One
I’ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I’ll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club; instead of bitches, I’d hang with a group of nuns
And everyone I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven’t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain’t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don’t know if you do or don’t exist
It's drivin' me crazy, send your condolences
This is me reachin' to you, so don’t forget
If Hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I’ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feelin' says it’s all fake
I hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith
This isn’t a small phase, my perspective’s all changed
My thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren’t real, then all my prayers aren’t worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could sit in church and say “fuck” in the services
Man, what if Jesus was a facade?
Then that would mean the government’s God
I feel like they’ve been brainwashin' us with a lot
So much that we don’t even notice that we’re stuck in a box
Man, everything is “what if?” — why is it always “what if?”
Planet Earth “what if?”, the Universe “what if?”
My sacrifice “what if?!”, my afterlife “what if?!”
Every fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect
I’m fuckin' done! I’m fuckin' done!
This is my fuckin' life and I’m livin' it, I’m havin' fun
If you really care for me
Prove that I need to live carefully!
But I’ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside
For an afterlife that isn’t even guaranteed
We are you, and you’re us — stop playin' games!
My life’s all I got, and Heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I'm in Hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and I’ll just do me
I’m a human, I’ll stay in my lane; Ill mind

Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
I guess (Yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)

I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop

Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it.

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

Uh-huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?

A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo!)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at

Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it

[Verse 1]
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemar, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a nigga talk, a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed
And for that shit, you got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money

You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it

That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas

You called me weak

You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations

Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down

Mort est son avenir proche
Les anges de l'enfer l'escortent
Le hashtag #Vie tient peut-être d'elle
De son cou pendu à la corde
Trop jeune pour comprendre l'impact des mots
J'm'en fous de c'qu'elle veut tant que j'ai ce qu'il me faut
Treize ans déjà mon premier rapport
Depuis mon cœur a fermé la porte
Aussi bizarre que cela puisse paraître
Après l'avoir ken' j'voulais qu'elle disparaisse
Elle voulait qu'on s'aime mais je n'voulais pas
J'étais l'dernier à faire le premier pas
Plus les années passent et plus lourde est la tâche
J'la trouvais pas bonne et j'voulais qu'elle le sache
Dans la méchanceté, j'me sentais si bien
J'étais loin d'imaginer son quotidien
Des larmes séchées sur ses poèmes
Qu'elle m'écrivait en recherchant plaisir clitoridien
Faux-cul, j'étais comme un "Allez l'OM"
Scandé par un supporter parisien
Le jour de son suicide, je n'en revenais pas
La veille, elle voulait que j'la prenne dans mes bras
Mais j'suis pas doué dès qu'on s'éloigne des draps
J'suis plus dans le "suce-moi et concentre-toi"
Dernier message, elle parle au répondeur
"Allô Damso, j'vais faire sonner mon heure"
J'décrochais pas, j'voulais pas faire d'erreur
Qu'elle m'casse les couilles, c'est ce dont j'avais peur
C'était la dernière fois qu'j'entendais ses pleurs
Elle était morte et pourtant, je lui ai dit : "À tout à l'heure"

Vingt-trois ans aujourd'hui, y'a dix ans déjà
Que j'prie pour que l'amnésie s'en prenne à moi
J'assume mes actes en fumant des noix
Pt'être que son avenir me pardonnera
Le jour de l'enterrement, j'm'en battais les couilles
Bizarrement, c'est comme si j'sentais pas les coups
En même temps, j'étais pas là pour voir sa dépouille
J'rappais pendant que le prof donnait cours
Jeune délinquant très mal dressé
Menottes à plein temps, poignets blessés
Négros des champs, chiasse dans l'WC
M'a dit le caissier avant d'encaisser
Énervé, j'lui ai foutu une patate dans le menton
J'ai pris c'qu'il avait dit pour argent comptant
Premier braquage sans trop faire exprès
C'fils de putain n'avait pas d'espèce
J'm'enferme dans la drogue douce
Brin de whisky dans le juice
J'oublie cette vie que j'ai ôtée
Son cul plat dont j'me suis moqué
Ampoule de verre dépolie
Ressort mon teint défraîchi
J'me souviens d'cette vie qu'j'ai ôtée
Son 86B que j'ai peloté
J'me construis plus dans l'regard des autres
J'suis ni des leurs, ni des vôtres, ni des nôtres
Cul terreux loin des beaux bâtiments
Remords hideux, sombre châtiment
C'était la dernière fois qu'je sentais son pouls
Elle était morte et pourtant, je lui ai dit : "I love you"

[Refrain]
Depuis je fume pour l'oublier
Je fume pour oublier qu'j'l'ai tuée
Depuis je fume pour l'oublier
Je fume pour oublier qu'j'l'ai tuée
Depuis je fume pour l'oublier
Je fume pour oublier qu'j'l'ai tuée
Depuis je fume pour l'oublier
Je fume pour oublier qu'j'l'ai tuée

I just want a Picasso
In my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I want a Rothko, no I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing
Marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it

[Verse 3]
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop"
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take for me to go
For you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby

Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this

The challenges we’re facing

And you need time
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees."
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!"

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 1]
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love

[Intro]
You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?" — Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace
But you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, "he-art"
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?
I would feel so much, much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time
Bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?

Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand
Than the next strand, better than the next strand
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a fuck, that's a misconception
Oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I said, oh what a night, oh what a night
Yeah she a bad bitch, all jokes aside

Hey, look at baby over there

She broke it down started moving like Shakira
Like she do it in the mirror

Chop one, chop two, chop that ass down

All I want you to do is just drop that ass down
Drop drop that ass down, now look back at it

Middle school, I was getting head on a ten speed
Gigolo blood line, pimpin' hereditary
Black on 28's, it remind of February
Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

Hey, look at baby over there

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there
Now make a nigga feel welcome like a doormat's there
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I'm like, oh what a night, oh what a night
That's a bad bitch, all jokes aside

Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron

And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah

Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeah
And she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys, then I play all day (All day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (All day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're goin'
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fuckin' 20, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? (Woah)
I hear noises in the bathroom (Woah)
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you excited?
You excited

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side

The dirty, the money is homicide
And my recipe can't be televised

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side
Now nothing's big as my ego, Push

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

[Verse 4: Casino]
Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe, with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga tricked up
Now he spendin' that money with Casino!

Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother’s name

When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I’m dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away…
Someday, someday
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday

[HAMILTON]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I’m looking for

There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn’t around

[BURR]
My father wasn’t around

[HAMILTON & BURR]
I swear that
I’ll be around for you (I’ll be around for you)

[HAMILTON]
I’ll do whatever it takes

[BURR]
I’ll make a million mistakes

[BURR/HAMILTON]
I’ll make the world safe and sound for you…
…will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you, we’ll make it right for you

If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday

We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smoking out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner
Giving hell 'til it's frozen over
I ain't never ran from nothing

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the President
Ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had the chance
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to France
But someone’s gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that I’m already Senate-approved...

My friend James Madison, red in the face
He grabs my arm and

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
She got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figueroa pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them, old niggas, to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she ain’t "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga, I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but (Soul!)
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you, man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, now I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina
Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em

[Outro: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from the bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

[Verse]
Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga’s sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

Tongue, tongue-tongue-tongue-tongue
Twenty more shots then I pass out
But that's what I'm aiming for
Baby, let me drown
When I wake up, I'm still in the club
Looking at the DJ, like turn my shit up, oh
So when the beat-beat-beat-beat-beat drops
Get your ass on the floor

But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

Catch me, don't you catch me

I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

She gets him (you get me)

And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!" ‘cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Young rich niggas, in this motherfucker, huh

When you wake up before you brush your teeth
You grab your strap, nigga
Only time you get down on your knees
Shooting craps, nigga
Fuck what you heard, God blessin' all the trap niggas
God blessin' all the trap niggas

Weighed 1008 grams on the scale
I got a lower case T across my chest
Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck

Hasta Ia-la-uego wake up with that Glock, okay though
Stash the dope inside a Winnebago in Decatur
You got your work, you posted up in the hood Bodega
Lil' woadie loading up that yopper before he brush his teeth
Gotta roll a backwood up while he count the cheese
We on the turf, getting active on the backstreet
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing that relax me
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try to work a deal
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you’ll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here this shit wid-ild

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Tryna figure out the difference
But I think—think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle
Suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
You're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil Twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
K-Mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother)— Tihs! (Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', "Fuck! Shit! Fuck!"
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'"
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!"
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin) who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger
My suicide note's barely legible; read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin', "Fuck the police," like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"
No, I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same
Bitch

Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy

Look, broke hoes do what they can (Can)
Good girls do what they told (Told)
Bad bitches do what they want (They want)
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (Give 'em none)
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum (Egh!)

Seinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, "What, what's going on here," You know?
"Boy this thing is really, really goes high!"
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', "let him go"
And we ain't gettin' any younger

I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh baby
I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”

I think I'm fucking gone, rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeli'g I would give to

I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeli'g I would give to

Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him 20 million without blinkin'
He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
"Fuck wrong with everybody?" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was "He was talkin' too reckless!"
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', "Finish your breakfast!"
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston
Nah, JAY-Z
Bye, JAY-Z

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

Bebecita, sólo avisa...
Pa' subir los cristales
Prender y quitarme la camisa (woh)
Quiero que seas mi sumisa (sumisa)
Si quieres tómate tu tiempo, tranquila, no tengo prisa

Y el jevo tuyo no se da cuenta
Ese cabrón es feka, no tiene lo que aparenta, yeh
Tú eres mucho pa' él (woh)... eso es lo que comentan

[Verso 3: Lenny Tavárez]
(Lenny Tavárez, baby, eh-eh)
No sé si nos queremos (nos queremos)
Tú estás con él, pero hace tiempo que nos vemos (wuh)
Siempre que estamo' a solas, bellaqueamo' y nos comemos
Conmigo, tus venías se van al extremo
Y ese cabrón con esa película (brrrrra)
Ya tú no sales con él, te sientes ridícula (ridícula)
Prefieres quedarte solita en la casa pa' así llamarme
Y yo puesto pa' buscarte cuando me necesitas
Envíame un Snapchat de eso'...
Un selfie tirándome beso'
Voy de camino a bajarte el queso
Cuando cruzé la linea no me equivoqué
Si te descubren, di que yo te provoqué

[Coro: Alex Rose]

Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quédate conmigo y le' picheo a toda'
Como tú ninguna, tú le gana' a toda'

Me dices, bebecita, y nos vamo' a toda' (sh-sh)
Pa' comerte toda, yeh

[Verso 4: Lyanno]
Ly-Ly-Ly
Contigo tengo fantasías desde la High
Esposas y correas, sabes lo que hay
Hasta una con el Kush pa' ponerte high
Y en la cama a tu novio ya decirle "Bye"
Bruto, bruto con cojone'
Siempre usando el condón
Y pa' colmo te pone toda' mis cancione'
Pa' dejarlo te di sesenta y nueve mil razones
Tu toto late por mí más que 12 corazones
Y lo hacemo' lento, cuando nos besamo', se detiene el tiempo
Sin palabra', disfrutamos el momento... y repetimos el cuento

[Coro: Lyanno]
Baby, porque quiero maltratarte toda
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quédate conmigo y le' picheo a toda'
Como tú ninguna, tú le gana' a toda' (tú le gana' a toda')

[Verso 5: Rauw Alejandro]
(Yeah, Ra-Rauw)
Te hicieron para mí
Lo supe aquella noche que te tuve
A-Apreciando toda tu desnudez
Cuando mi lengua corría toda tu piel
Me hicieron para ti (oh-oh)
Lo supiste cuando gritabas mi nombre (hey)
Baby, yo soy el que te corresponde (ah)
Qué rico fumar antes de comernos
El destino nos cambió to' los planes (yeah)
Tú dime cuándo pa' volver a vernos (wuh)
Tienes algo más cabrón, ya olvídate de él

[Puente: Rauw Alejandro]
Además del sexo, mami, quiero amarte toda
Conmigo vas al cielo, tú te viene' toda
Quédate conmigo y le' picheo a toda'
Me dices, bebecita, que nos vamo' a toda', contigo voy a to'a, yeh

[Verso 6: Cazzu]
¿Cómo quieras, papi? ¿Rápido o lento?
Soy adicta a tu movimiento
Y aunque hay veces que yo te miento
En las noches se me nota lo que siento por ti
La gente diciéndono’ que somo' anormale'
Siempre nos comemo' como si fuésemo' animale'
Es lógico que me reclame'
Y sabes que si estoy con él, me llama' y desarmo los plane'
Sabe' bien que como yo no hay dos
Prendiendo uno, haciéndolo
Olvidándono' del reloj
Y que cuando ella te habla, tú te imagina' mi voz
Yo ya lo descubrí, que tú eres para mí, que yo soy para ti
Baby, quédate aquí, más cerquita de mí, él no me lo hace así

[Coro: Cazzu & Alex Rose]
Tú quieres comerme toda
Él me lo hace a medias, tú me besa' toda
Quédate conmigo y picheale a toda'
Como yo ninguna, yo le gano a toda'
Ven cómeme toda

Hoy yo quiero comerte toda
Él te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quédate conmigo y le' picheo a toda'
Me dices, bebecita, y nos vamo' a toda'
Pa' comerte toda, yeh

[Intro: Baka & Drake]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Kanye West]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say we 'bout to lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Bridge: Jeremih]
And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Refrain: Kanye West]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Chorus: Choir, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't feel like she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (Why?)
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (Out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

[Intro]
Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

[Verse 2]
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?

[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wait a minute, man
Hey, check this out, man (Tell it)
It was this blind man, right? (This man)
It was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick, right? (Hey)
He walked past this fish market (Fish market?), you know what I'm sayin'?
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
*sniffs* "Woo good morning ladies" (Hahahahaha)
You like that shit, man?
Hey man, I've got a gang of that shit, man
Hey, I'll tell you what
We'll all have a good time
We'll fool on the drum
And hey, hey if everybody crowd around the mic'
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it, homeboy

[Chorus]
Said Colt 45 and two zigzags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

[Verse 1]
Well, it was just sundown in a small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale (Well)
When the Afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale
Well, I was standing on the corner sellin' rap CDs
When I met a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my Caddy
Because I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed
Fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (Left)
Fucked to the right (Right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
Thought to myself, "sheeba-sheeba"
Got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
And so I ran, I jumped out the back window
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh, he beat me to the left
He beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Chorus]
Said Colt 45 and two zigzags, baby, that''s all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell,  flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

[Verse 2]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo
See, I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said "AIEE!"
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders' wife in the state of Kentucky
She said, "I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me"
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs 'n' Spices

[Chorus]
Said Colt 45 and two zigzags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

[Verse 3]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said, "Yes, Miss Daisy"
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her (Haha)
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man, I thought I told ya?
Met this beautiful sexy ho
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it
I know I'ma cry when she get deported

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two zigzags, baby, that''s all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

[Verse 4]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good? (Say what?)
I mean, you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you, "Where you from?"
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad 'cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on yo' ass
Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off

[Outro]
Said Colt 45 and two zigzags baby that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed

Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn ni**er
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned (I'm just fucking around)

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

[Hook 2: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a (squeaky) sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kelly Clancy]
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!

The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

[Verse 1: Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long

It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
Is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on

All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novella
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me

But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece

And a nigga be dressin', walkin' 'round, Gucci steppin'
Unintentional flexin', tryna send out a message
Money walk with the extra, shake that ass wit' ya bestie
Seein' stars in the rental, got your broad in the rental
20K in A.O.D. and it's just me and my kinfolk
Tryna send a girl to college, I ain't coppin' no free show
Say her birthday late July, yeah, that means she a Leo
Might just leave with me tonight, but that don't mean she a freak ho
Fuck with dancers and models, shout out them girls who get dollars
Shawty came from the bottom, yeah, shout out Keisha Bottoms
Couple cases of Rosé, came out to me with the sparklers
I pour up for all the girls, but I'ma drink out the bottles

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Juicy J]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine (I got you Swae)
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign (Juicy J) (yeah, ho)

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
She got that million dollar pussy, but I get it for the free
She like to do a lot of snow, I told that bitch to come and ski
Shawty bad, she can get it, she can swallow, she can spit it
Bring her friend, if she with it, on the pole, y'all can split it
In the bed or the Lamb' (or the Lamb')
Got your bitch suckin' dick on the 'Gram (on the 'Gram)
V12 helped me get up out the jam (out the jam), trunk full of slam
R.I.P. Lil Peep, I gotta slow down on them Xans (hey)
Just had a ménage (hey), back seat of my Benz (hey)
Put that shit on camera (hey), she squirted on the lens (hey)
Then she told me put it on her chinny chin-chin (hey)
Pocket full of nothin' but them Benjy Franklins
In the game, posted up (up), puttin' numbers up (up)
Bitch, run me that check first, I don't wanna fuck (yeah)
They say it's cuffin' season, baby, you ain't good enough (nope)
She want a real nigga, dawg, you ain't hood enough

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign

Tell me that I don't deserve to ball
Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I
I will not waiver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit the Wall Street traffic, took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the zzz's (Uh)
Poppin' the polar opposite to the NZT (Uh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name brand (Name brand)
But I done seen how the Xan did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone till November
All my city calls me Simba
Dreams are made for cages, nigga
Lions are for real, nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills, nigga
Fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red (Whoo!)
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Bridge: Tinashe]
Do you get lonely?
Sure, I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slumber and I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me

Ohhh... I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you

All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much (I drink too much)

All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)

California love
California knows how to party

In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

[Chorus: Roger Troutman]
California knows how to party

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun

So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roam never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
In the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that
I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass

She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent
Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya (splashhhh)
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost
(Cause I've had some issues) Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Pshh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K

Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper

Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in

Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me

And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction

It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views" and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings
We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the Earth!
White power!

Bitches suck my dick, 'cause I'm fly like Aladdin
Scum Gang!

These bitches think I'm stupid, I ain't stupid
Dummy boys fall in love with it, he stupid
All these hoes on my body, cut the bullshit
All these hoes, they ain't loyal, y'all lookin' stupid
I just left Starlets and I ain't even cash out
Back out, straight to the trap house, I blow her back out
I'll pull her tracks out, got her running like it's track now
Like a Smackdown, rock bottom I'ma pin her down
Hold up, let me get it started

Bitch, you used to fuckin' leave me on seen and shit

Went to the Eastside, spanked out Juju
Lucky I ain't have it on me, I was gon' shoot you
Spanked him on camera, threw it on YouTube
Stupid lil' dumb nigga, now you on YouTube
If a nigga want beef, I'm the type to drag it
Shoot you while you with your bitch then it's back to mackin'
Police pull up on me, I don't know what happened
Police pull up on you, you gon' get to yappin'
We gon' get to clappin', we been on static
Semi-automatics, they gon' get to clappin'
We ain't with the chattin', you lil' niggas cappin'

[Verse 1: Pastor Jim Colerick]
Well, I wrote this song for the Christian youth
I wanna teach kids the Christian truth
If you wanna reach those kids on the street
Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat
So I gave my sermon an urban kick
My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
That's 'cause Jesus Christ is my nigga
Woo!

[Verse 2: Pastor Jim Colerick]
He's a life-changer, miracle arranger
Born to the virgin mom in a manger
Water to wine, he's a drink exchanger
And he died for your sins
I preach the word, that's my gig
And I rhyme better than Notorious B.I.G
All the other MCs, I wish them well
But if you live in sin, you burn in hell
Now I'ma pass the mic to my lovely wife
She's a fly MC and the light of my life
So to bust a rhyme without further ado
Take it away, Mary Sue!

[Verse 3: Mary Sue Colerick]
Jesus Christ is my nigga
He's the son of the original G
And he was sent to Earth to elucidate the way that we should be (What?)
Like if another MC says, "You're a freak!
You're a lame-butt rapper and your rhymes are weak!"
I don't get mad and I don't critique
I forgive him, and turn the other cheek
I don't blaspheme and I don't brag
I don't cuss, and my pants don't sag
I do exude a little Christian swag
And I'm proud to be an American!

[Verse 4: Pastor Jim Colerick & Mary Sue Colerick]
Jesus Christ is our nigga
Let his light shine through ya!
Let his love pop a cap in your butt and say hallelujah
Jesus Christ is our nigga
He's a homie MC, JC, you see
He's an honest, caring, peace-loving nigga like me

[Verse 5: Pastor Jim Colerick & Mary Sue Colerick]
If you do drugs and you think you're cool
You need to come to Sunday school!
Put those drugs in a garbage can
Stand up tall, you're a Christian man!

[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sad ?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

Never do get it

Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is

Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Don’t tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it

Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’ma drive it like it’s stolen
I’ma fix it like it’s broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions

And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don’t gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

Only thing I know is you’re my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin’
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
Hand me the brush and say “paint it”
Give me your heart and I hold it
Show me your soul and I'll mold it
Baby boy, you gotta be the dopest
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

Five six seven eight nine—

[BURR]
There are ten things you need to know

[COMPANY]
Number one!

[BURR]
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Number two!

[BURR]
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[BURR]
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

[BURR]
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[BURR]
Now I didn’t know this at the time
But we were—

[BURR AND PHILIP & HAMILTON]
Near the same spot (Near the same spot)
Your son died, is that (My son died, is that)
Why—(Why—)

[COMPANY]
Six!

[BURR]
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[BURR]
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

[BURR]
They won’t teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[BURR]
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

[COMPANY]
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He’s with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side

Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza

My love, take your time
I’ll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

He aims his pistol at the sky—

Wait!

I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

[BURR AND ANGELICA]
Angelica and Eliza—

[BURR]
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I’m the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now I’m the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I should’ve known
I should’ve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

[Intro: Choir & Rick Ross]
And I know the sun will rise with me (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (I got it now) (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink (huh!)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (woo!)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views (views)
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (huh!), came to buy the bar (huh!)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (woo!)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (woo!)
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (running game)
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (fornicate)
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great (huh!)

My bitch drive a all white Range
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, Hall of Shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
Ayy, I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
Look in the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care how I crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states, I be doing the most
I got white-folks money that I won't blow
And if you ask why, 'cause the white folks don't

Big bank take lil' bank, bank

Yeah I sold dope, I had cornrows
I can you see niggas hatin' with the door closed
Now I'm lookin' for a glove with the sparkle on it
And my CBD got chocolate on it
Big bank take small-ass shit
Bank account on some tall-ass shit
Attitude on some "Fuck you too"
Bankroll on "What it do, boo?"
Meet me at the room at five
And if I ain't did it yet, I'll try

[Chorus: YG, YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

She said, "Whatchu' gon do if I leave?"
I said, "Bitch, I'ma do me"
B.I.G., bitch everything zoomed in (zoom)
Big bag on me lookin' like I'm movin' in (God!)
Got my foot in the door and we still here (here)
I'm a first generation millionaire (here)
I broke the curse in my family not having shit
I'm passionate like girls that's after more than just cash and dick
Feed me to the wolves, now I lead the pack and shit
You boys all cap, I'm more Colin Kaepernick
I'm rare as affordable health care (oh God)
Or going to wealth from welfare (Goddamn)
I turn my W's to M's, yeah, I flip those
I might buy her red bottoms with the crypto
Three coins, that'll pay ya whole semester (swerve, swerve)
But you gotta ride it better than a Tesla

[Chorus: YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank (lil' bitch)
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

Uh-oh! Back again
Back to back, Maybach, stack the Ms
Told em' I met Slim Shady, bagged a Em
Once he go black, he'll be back again
Tell them hoes that it's crunch time, abdomen
Yes, I cop mad Chanel and mad Given'
She did it again, imagine them
'Bout to make these bum bitches mad again
Uh-oh! Back to them
I lead the pack so my back's to them
Yup, the queen's back, what's happenin'?
Re-run, 'bout to make these bitches rap again
Uh, diamond chains on my ankle
Young Money in the cut like a shank, though
Tell T.I.P. rubber bands in my bankroll
Show my ass like a stank ho

Big bank take lil' bank

I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain: J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge: J. Cole, Yolanda DeBerry & Tanikka Myers]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner

Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov

Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel

Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...

I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)

[Letra de "Odio" ft. Drake]

[Intro: Drake, Romeo Santos]
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Interludio: Romeo Santos & Drake]
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', "Black Lives Matter"
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', "Nigga," this, and, "Nigga," that
Call everybody, "Nigga," and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, "Nigga," then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, "All Lives Matter," is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, "Nigga," is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine

[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist

I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I don’t belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I don’t know what's up

Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"

If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

Les larmes de la misère ont l'goût de ma haine
À bout de souffle, ma haine me redonne de l'oxygène

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Chorus]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Chorus]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Chorus]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don’t cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Hello? What the deal? Bet

[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 1]
Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 2]
There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 3]
Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just high yella you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

And you can drop your panties
Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus

[Intro]
Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

Oh-woah, trust issues

Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
"Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards"
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
